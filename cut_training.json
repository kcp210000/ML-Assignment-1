The vaulted ceilings, light fixtures and finishes are all cool, but this place is just huge.

I had this gripe when I ate at Mandalay's noodle shop a few weeks ago when my lunch special was an astonishing $18 for a soup and lunch-portioned dish. Apparently the property really likes to take advantage of their massive convention crowds. With everything from breakfasts, salads, burgers, entrees and desserts you can certainly find something you'd like, just expect to pay handsomely for it. Also, they use the words 'specialty' and 'signature' quite a bit on their menu, but looking around at other people's dishes and based on my meal this definition seems to be based around providing mediocre, high priced sandwiches.\n\nMy classic hamburger was placed in front of me and looked as mediocre as it tasted. The bun was dry and a bit too big, but well-proportioned to the patty. Not sure if you have a choice of cheeses, but when I asked for a cheeseburger I wasn't offered any options and was given American cheese. The presumably frozen patty had ok char flavor, but was of your extremely generic back yard BBQ variety, and very overcooked at that.

One small slice of not too fresh tomato didn't provide much coverage, but I had plenty of pickles, lettuce and red onion at my disposal. Overall this had nothing great going on. \n\nMy waffle fries sucked as they always do, and considering the menu gives you the option of skinny fries, potato salad or coleslaw I'm not quite sure why I got these stupid fries. They're clearly never fresh due to how they're made, so why bother? Plus, $21 for a burger and iced tea is about $9 more than you should pay for this, even in a casino setting capitalizing on desperate conventioneers. After this awful experience, combined with Burger Bar's drop off, I can probably now claim that there are no decent burger options south of Tropicana along the Strip until you get much more south away from the casinos.

I was wandering Coventry to see what's changed since i was here as a kid, and I had some time reserved for a decent dinner-for-one at the bar after a 5-hour plane ride.\n\nThe bartender was very kind to offer me a taste of the wine before I got a full glass. Unfortunately, the glass smelled like bubble gum and had lip prints all over it because it hadn't been properly washed. Too bad he didn't check before he poured, as most bartenders would. He promptly re-poured, and the wine was fine.\n\nI've lived on both coasts and worked in restaurants during college, so I know enough to stay away from seafood in the Midwest. I try to order seasonally and locally. Today is June 25. It is most definitely tomato season and I'm in a city where I expect people can appreciate heirlooms, so I ordered the caprese salad.\n\nIt was composed of thick slabs of hard, flavorless SYSCO tomato ice-cold from the fridge, interlaced with just-ok fresh mozzarella. I even checked the plate for condensation to see if it had been pre-assembled and pulled from the cooler (I don't think it had). This burger-sized stack was topped with Italian salad dressing. From a bottle. This is just wrong. And scattered with some arugula, which they mistakenly call \"micro-greens\".\n\nA caprese salad is, in my opinion, pretty hard to screw up. It's just a few good ingredients, sliced and put on a plate with some oil, totally un-fussy. But this assemblage was so bad, I did not finish it.\n\nThere's no excuse for this. You can't charge $8 for this pile. I don't want to pay for the two guys behind the bar to shoot the shit instead of serving the three of us who are seated there.\n\nOnce i got the barkeep's attention I tried to cancel my second-course order so i could leave, but it had already been fired. In fact, when I asked about canceling it was sitting in the window, getting cold.\n\nThe foie gras was okay, but was basically overpowered by the risotto on which it had been parked. There was a green oil on the plate which could only be appreciated visually.\n\nIf you're going to put up this kind of a facade with the decor, you cannot fall this short on food. I'd suggest that they skip the pretense of being a restaurant and focus on drinks and music, which the other reviewers seem to appreciate. It is a good space for a bar/club vibe, so unless their liquor license is dependent on having a menu they should toss it in the trash.

First bad sign, there was no line to get into the club. As you know the most poppin clubs in Vegas have lines out the a^&. Yea those lines suck, but once you get in, it's magical. So we got into Tao, me and my boys, and it wasn't really that magical, in fact, I would say it's anti-magical. The club is dark as hell, I'm asian and I think I turned black, was fun to role play though. Let me hit the main spots in bullet points.\n\nDance floor. The dance floor is poo. Not actual poo, but it's extremely small, it's quite bad. The dance floor feels like it can only fit 20 people, and the bad thing is that it's so narrow. So the dance floor is in the middle of the club, so if you want to go from inside to outside, you pretty much have to go through the dance floor.

My advice to anyone in the same situation - refinance immediately.  It will be worth every penny of your closing costs.\n\nAs i mentioned, we have only been dealing with Roundpoint for 3 months, but we have had to call them dozens of time to deal with numerous issues.  First, we tried to pay our December mortgage payment online, only to find that the system was down.  We mailed a physical check, which Roundpoint lost internally.  A few days before our payment was due, we noticed our payment still hadn't been processed, so we called and were told to make the payment online (the online system was now fixed) and cancel the check.  We did that, and didn't even complain about paying the $20 out of our own pocket to cancel the check.  Three weeks later, Roundpoint apparently found our check and attempted to cash it.  When they couldn't, they tried to slap us with a fine for an NSF check - even though THEY were the ones that recommended that we cancel the original check.  After a few phone calls, we finally got the fee waived.\n\nDays later, we received a marketing email from Roundpoint, on which hundreds of other customer email addresses (including ours) were visible to everyone.  This is certainly a security threat, as even a novice hacker could likely use the email addresses to access information that could easily lead to identity theft. Roundpoint sent a pathetic letter of apology, but did little to assure their customers that their information would be protected.\n\nOur biggest problems with Roundpoint are still ongoing,  A couple of weeks after we closed on our home, we had a flood in our house due to a disconnected pipe.  We filed a claim with our insurance company immediately, and were pleasantly surprised at how easy our insurance company was to work with and how quickly they sent us the check for repairs.  Because our house is mortgaged through Roundpoint, though, the checks are made out to both us AND Roundpoint.  We hoped that Roundpoint would be as easy to work with as our insurance company was.  Not the case.  At all.  Because the damage to our house was over $10K, Roundpoint requires that periodic inspections are done in order to release the funds back to us to complete the repairs.  They assured us that they would release 20% up front for us to begin the repairs.  That was nearly four weeks ago, and we still have not seen a dime of OUR money. In the first week of this fiasco, when we had not received the check they assured us had been sent, we called Roundpoint only to find that they were awaiting additional paperwork from us.  No one bothered to reach out and let us know that they needed this paperwork - they simply waited for us to call in to tell us they needed it.  When we asked the customer service rep why no one had contacted us, her response was something along the lines of \"we don;t have a team that is responsible for reaching out to customers to resolve issues\"  Seriously?!?  How do you NOT have this?  We submitted the paperwork immediately (within an hour) and were told that now, with the paperwork in place, our check would certainly be released.  Three weeks later, no check.  Every time we call, we get another absurd story about where the check is.  Mind you this check is for 20% of our funds, and was intended for us to BEGIN repairs.  My husband and I are expecting a baby in less than a week, and could not wait for this inept company to release our funds to begin repairs,  At this point, we have paid the initial repair costs out of our own pocket, and our repairs will be completely finished this week.  We have also called Roundpoint repeatedly to request that they send an inspector so that the remainder of our funds will be released.  We have asked Roundpoint to request the inspection 6 times in the last 4 weeks.  To date, no one has called us to schedule the inspection.  Each time we call RPM, we're told that the request has been entered, and that someone will call us within 48 hours to schedule the inspection.  We are now in a loop of calling every 48 hours to let them know that no one has called us.  The last time I called, I asked to speak to a supervisor in order to escalate the request.  I was told that their phone systems don;t allow them to transfer calls (what?!?!) but that a supervisor would return my call within the hour.  That was 5 days ago.  No call.  I am going to have to call them again today, and I'm sure I'll be going though exactly the same unproductive process that I have been going through for the last 4 weeks.

I showed her a pic of what I wanted, not worried about it cause hair grows back... well she cut it super short and used a razor which is a big no no with my wavy texture. I told her I didn't want the razor and she said it wasn't a razor and it was a \"thinner\" and she would only use it a little... I walked out with what I thought was an ok hair cut only to wash it and have it look like a kindergartner had cut it. It was extremely choppy and even my flat iron couldn't make it look decent. I quickly canceled my color for fear of having her ruin the color too. The only problem is I had purchased the yelp deal for $100 and I knew I didn't want to come back to her. I called the salon and asked if I could transfer or gift the groupon because i wasn't pleased with my hair cut. The owner agreed to let me transfer it to my neighbor, told me to come in to have his wife \"fix\" my hair...I didn't want to come in, I was embarrassed but they assured me it was ok and Ashlee wouldn't know. I came in and they proceeded to tell me that Ashlee said I asked for a \"disconnected cut\" and that's why she did it... ummm mind you I don't even know that term. But Ashlee swore I said those word. It was embarrassing and I felt so small yet I let Carol go through and blend it in...I have to admit, she did a really good job blending in the choppy mess with out cutting too much more off. I was embarrassed but it did look better. She scheduled me for another appointment with her and offered a deep conditioning treatment free for my trouble. \n\nSo about 8 months later I call to get a hair cut/trim and they book me for a 10:30 am. I show up and wait... 10:48 am and I'm still waiting... at about 11 am Carol finally walks up and says it will only be a few minutes and apologizes for the wait... I still end up waiting between 5-10 minutes... it felt like a lifetime. Finally she tells me to come on back and offers to wash my hair, I told her I already washed it and she tells me that she's going to wet it any way and she ends up washing it... I tell her what I want and tell her I'm not worried about the rest of it but mostly want a full bang... she says ok and then cuts my hair. She then begins to blow dry it telling me she wants to see how my bangs dry before she cuts more and as she is doing this she blow drys my hair and begins to flat iron it... I didn't ask for a style as I'm going home to 3 small children but too late now. I feel like it's taking forever and tell her, \"you don't need to flat iron my hair I'm going home right after\" but she is pretty much 1/2 way done. Needless to say, the one thing I was most looking forward to, my bangs, does not look right... it keeps parting in the middle and my hair part is always parted on the side but when she cut it, she parted it in the middle so it's being very stubborn. She then hands me the flat iron to see if I can fix it and it still wouldn't sit right (probably not her fault) so I mentioned using water a few times but my whispered plea went unanswered (maybe she didn't have a plain water spray bottle?) she finally finishes and I notice one side of my bangs is longer and keeps going in my eyes so I ask her if it's longer and she says no so i say ok... I walk up to pay and it's $48. I'm pretty sure she charged me for shampoo and style when I specifically said I didn't want them but I pay any way because she did do them. I tipped her 15% cause I wasn't happy with the price unless the prices went up but last time I paid $36 or $38... needless to say I'm in my car and I notice my bangs are uneven.

However, I've had my car worked on a few times by Igor and his employees and this last time was left very disappointed. It wasn't about the quality of the work because they fixed what needed to be fixed but they neglected to clean up after themselves and left the interior of my vehicle less than what I dropped it off ( I cleaned my car before I dropped it off so I know how clean it was). \n\nThe first part of my review is about how they left the interior of my vehicle disgusting and a mess! The interior of my vehicle is beige and I got it back black and dirty. The first time it happened no big deal I cleaned the oil off my door panels, carpet, and steering wheel. I didn't even complain.  I do not have dirty cars period it's gross and I get them detailed and cleaned very often as I have custom paint so when it happened again I was PISSED!!!!!! Not only did I have oil hand prints on both beige door panels but an oil foot print on the floor of the driver side but how I have floor mats! There was dirt on my back seat black seat covers (I bought black seat covers just to make sure the interior of the car stayed clean) there was also foot prints from a child putting their feet all over the back of the passenger seat. So was someone using my car as their personal ride?! There was trash in my back seat from someone eating as well as a car battery not mine because I get my batteries from AAA. So it was treated like a trash can as well. My kids get chewed out if they leave a empty water bottle in my car. I don't even eat in my car nor allow anyone else so if you can only imagine I am fuming! I have taken my car to many shops and NEVER EVER HAD THIS HAPPEN!!!! I got my car back and it took me 4 hours to clean it and I still couldn't remove all the oil from the door panel which means I have to take it to get professionally cleaned. Also, I had one of my front bumper vents missing after I got my car back they snap in to the vehicle and you have to pull it pretty hard for it to come off so I couldn't understand why that was missing so that was something else I had to buy myself. \n\nSecond issue I had while Igor had my car was the length of time he kept it. The second time I allowed them to \"care\" for my car he had it weeks at a time because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it the first time they had it for 3.5 weeks. Which was fine at first because we are fortunate enough to have multiple vehicles (I thought I would get it back sooner as I don't use my sports car as a daily driver). However,  He did not keep me updated on my car and I had to contact him. Hello you have my car I would suggest that you communicate with the customer not the other way around! So after they had my car which seemed like forever  I had to pick it up take it to the dealership pay $$$ to get it diagnosed there and then bring it back to Igor (1st time I cleaned my vehicle also but I could have paid the dealership to fix my car as money is not an issue but I thought he would be a good personal mechanic for my car). After I had that done it still took them over a week and a half to get working on my vehicle. I told him exactly what I wanted fix the day I dropped it off. The day I am supposed to pick my car up I get a text message asking me if I wanted to have my window fixed while it was there. WTF are you talking about?!!!!!!!!! I know my driver side window doesn't function properly but it functions properly enough for me I know how to work the shit on my car because it's mine (plus he was already informed my window didn't function properly). I was just dumbfounded because I did not know that working under the hood required that you roll the window down.  This window makes a very obvious audible crunching sound at about half way which would indicate stop wtf you are doing because it doesn't sound right however, his employee continued to roll it down and break plastic within the panel. How and why would you ask your customer to pay for something they didn't break?! He made me feel like I should pay for it regardless also he told me I can take it somewhere else and have it repaired. This is when I picked it up and saw how gross it was on the inside too. \n\nAfter all of this I finally have my car back safe and sound in my garage nice and clean. If I would have gotten my vehicle back in the condition in which I gave it to him I would not have complained about anything gave him a 5 star review and continued to be a customer. Lesson learned I will be taking my car to a shop where work is guaranteed, done in a timely manner and wouldn't get it back with oil and garbage in it.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "I could only imagine how bad the service in a restaurant could be, until I visited Sushi Ken with my family on 8/12/2012 for lunch.   The waitresses who served our table, (I really wish I knew her name, she is the taller one, with *less* Japanese accent),  she had provided the worst service I have ever seen, it was as if she did everything in the purpose of offending customers.\n\n(1) Our party has 6 adult and 3 kids occupying 3 tables putting together, when she came over to take order, I was sitting at the other side of tables and I told her \"I am ready to order\", she said \"That's what I am here for.\" and just stood still there, I had to raise my voice to finish ordering for everyone.  I mean, I was the one who's talking and couldn't she just move a few steps toward me ?\n\n(2) We ordered some sushi rolls and 5 complete meals, she told us we will get 5 appetizers and asked if we want salad or Edamame, we said 3 salad's and 2 Edamame's, and they were served as ordered, no problem here.\n\nLater on she brought over 4 bowls of miso soup.  I think it is quite normal for anyone to expect 5, right ?  So I asked her \"Shouldn't it be five?\"  Guess what?  SHE ASKED ME: \"WHY?\"  \n\nOh my god, she asked me back \"WHY\" and then we went totally silence after that.  It took me about 10 seconds to guess and said \"is it because one of our meals only comes with appetizer, but not soup ?\",  then she said \"uh -ah\" and walked away.  Are you serious ??\n\n(3) After we had our fried rice and curry beef plates delivered, we looked around on our tables for spoon and not finding any, I waved her over and said that we need spoons for eating THIS fried rice and THAT curry rice.  I even pointed at these two plates because I was already afraid of mis-communication.\n\nThen she brought over \"one\" spoon!!  1, o-n-e, single, uno !!\n\nI told her again that we needed two, she stared at me as if I should have told her exactly how many I wanted.  Hello? I told you we need it FOR THE FRIED RICE AND THE CURRY RICE !!  IT IS YOUR PROBLEM serving plates that need spoons to work on, and not bring spoons with them, not my problem.\n\n(4) After that moment I think her attitude turned from \"not friendly\" to \"rude\", when she brought over my noodle, SHE THREW THE BOWL WITH NOODLE SOUP TO MY HANDS, can you believe that !?  She delivered the noodle to my hands, not my table !!  What if I did not catch it ??\n\nShe definitely had gone over my edge at that time, if I were not with my parents and kids, I would have exploded right away, it was my family that prevented a confrontation from happening right there. \n\n(5) The food is plain, actually after all of the above happening, I didn't care about the foods anymore even they were 5-star quality.  \n\nAfter the kids were fed, I waved her a couple times for check and I don't know if she overlooked me deliberately or she really didn't see me, after about 5 minutes I walked over to the cashier's stand and asked her \"Can we have the check, please?\".  YES I SWEAR TO GOD THAT I STILL USED THE WORD 'PLEASE' TO HER.   \n\nShe did not bother to raise her head or even speak up, she just keep doing what she is doing, and nod her head.   At that time I immediately told myself two things:\n\n(1) I am not stepping into this restaurant ever again in my life, and\n\n(2) I will do whatever it takes to let the store manager know what happened today, or let the store owner (if she happens to be the manager).

I was mislead by the location because of the picture but that is on me. The following is the complaint I will be submitting to the American Psychiatric Association for the treatment I received at her office:\nI visited Dr. Saleha Baig's office on 9/19/17 at 4pm with an appointment time of 4:15. I knew I would need to fill out new patient paperwork so I arrived early. After completing the paperwork, I was waiting in the waiting room with about 4 other patients. Dr. Baig's office door was left open and I could clearly hear every conversation with every patient. This made me question her confidentiality of patient information but I was in need of a new doctor for a prescription refill so I continued to wait. After two hours of waiting I finally was called back to Dr. Baig's office. Her door was still left open when I came in but I was the last patient since it was just after 6pm. She proceeded to greet me and I began to tell her a bit about my background. Then she asked if I was still taking the medications (she said about five different medications) and I said no I had no idea what she was talking about and then she called me by the wrong patient last name and she realized I not only I was a completely different patient, but I was a brand new patient. She then immediately stood up and started yelling for her receptionist Diane. Diane then entered Dr. Baig's office and Dr. Baig was scolding her in front of me about not scheduling new patients at six o'clock. That is when the receptionist informed her that my appointment was at 4:15 and I had been waiting the whole time. Dr. Baig continued to scold her saying she could not have new patients after four and that the receptionist is overbooking her and this is unacceptable. I then told Dr. Baig she did not need to see me and I could find another doctor. Dr. Baig said I could stay and she would see me but continued to scold the receptionist, and explain that she would need to pray and then see me (I have no prejudice against anyone's beliefs or practices but this would have meant more waiting and I already felt like I was a burden to her at this point). I began to cry because the reason for my visit was a decline in my mental well being and overwhelming stress, in which this instance with Dr. Baig reprimanding her receptionist was causing me more stress. I asked the receptionist and Dr. Baig to destroy my file because I would be seeing a new doctor. About thirty minutes after I left I received a call from Dr. Baig's office and it was Dr. Baig herself. She apologized for acting in that matter, saying she had not used the restroom since the morning and she was very stressed out. I have this voicemail on my phone and I am willing to share it if needed. I find this extremely inappropriate to say as a mental health specialist, especially since I am a teacher and understand that I cannot blame my actions in front of a classroom of students for simple reasons such as not using the restroom. I felt all of Dr. Baig's actions were extremely inappropriate and now I am frantically trying to find a new mental health provider to refill my current prescription and now to help me overcome the stress of my current situation and the situation I encountered with Dr. Baig. As a mental health provider, Dr. Baig should be much more aware of her actions and the way she communicates with her staff, especially in front of a brand new patient. I will be making my insurance aware of Dr. Baig's behavior so that they may consider taking her off the list of in network providers because I would not want anyone else to have to endure that kind of behavior. I would like confirmation that Dr. Baig has been made aware of this situation and hopefully reprimanded for how the situation unfolded.\n\nI will be posting this on as many public forums as possible.

Unfortunately, my vehicle failed the safety inspection due to excessive rusting on the front and rear rotors.  The rusting led to excessive stress on the brake pads, which then required replacements.  The manager (?) told me the quote to fix the rotors and brakes would be ~$840, all inclusive.  Being new to this Midas, I went to check the price with other mechanics.  I went to Walt's on Baum Boulevard, who was able to conduct the SAME repairs and inspections for $641.  I called the Midas manager to alert him of the price difference.  After a few minutes, he said he would match the price.  In the end, I decided to go to Walt's since he was transparent on his work and pricing.  Despite Midas' willingness to match the price, I was extremely turned off by how much they charged me and then moved to the lower price once the competition presented its quote.  As a customer, I feel that Midas is being dishonest with its customers and not transparent with what they are doing and charging.

There's still hope, right?) \n\"I couldn't take off the salad, because I can't refund you for something you ate. I'm not sure if there was some misunderstanding about the coming out part.\"  Hand to God, that's what she said! \"Okaaaaay?\" I replied....\"I DID take off the spaghetti and meatballs though and wanted to let you know that.

Enjoy\n\nUPDATE-  FROM 5 start down to 1.  \nBrought the whole family there today on Easter Sunday.  Not impressed anymore.  Crab stuffed mushrooms were good but lacking the crab.  I ordered shaved prime rib Cuban and it was the driest, toughest sandwich I have ever had.  The worst part about the sandwich was the chunks of dry fat that they put in the sandwich absolutely tasted like leather and when you bit into one of them it would just pull inches of dried fat out of the middle of the sandwich. It was impossible to eat. My son got a steak that was overcooked and underseasoned. Mashed potatoes were very dry and tasteless. We ordered pizza for one of our twins and the pizza was literally melted to the piece of paper that it came out on. It was microwaved and tough. Seriously if you're going to serve food for kids it should be on the same level as what you're going to get the adults. Surely you can do better than this.  I'm very disappointed with this visit as I was looking forward to having a really good place to eat without having a 30 minute drive.  Not once did we ever see a manager came by and asked our meal was and the bathroom was absolutely disgusting.  It's hard to believe that the sink was as dirty as it was for about 1215 on a Sunday afternoon. It was filthy! The hallway leading to the bathroom could also use some housekeeping.

It is wrong, very very wrong.\n\nMajor Problem One - BYOE (where E is for Everything).\nI have gone here for dinner twice.  The first time was on the Monday of a long weekend, so I attributed the fact that the waitress had to run down a list of foods (with associated menu items) they had run out of, to a busier than expected first long weekend.  Tonight's visit had them out of 4 or 5 BEER selections..... IT IS A BREWHOUSE!  The waitress brought over the standard condiment caddy missing ketchup.  Being a ketchup user for my fries (requirement) I pointed out right away it was missing ketchup.  She said, so we're actually running low on ketchup so if I find one at another table, I will bring it by.  Letter in my meal, I noticed 7 or 8 giant ketchup bottles sitting on the counter in the kitchen.  I'm pretty sure there was bus boy or low ranked kitchen staff to fill up a few smaller table bottles to go around for customers.\n\nMajor Problem Two - Keep hot foods lukewarm?\nBoth dinners here, I received my food cold - well lukewarm, but considered cold in the food services standards. Having watched the movie \"Waiting\" too many times, I never send food back for any reason.  Plus who wants to wait another 30-40 minutes for their food.\n\nIf I received my food nice and hot as it's meant to eat, I'm sure I would have a great review for it.  Standard pub food with twist in a cool space in the busy waterfront area.\n\nManagement really needs to pull up their socks or if not, hire someone who has actual (management) experience in the food services industry.  I really feel sorry for the wait staff because they are just the messengers.  My husband and I never cheap-ed out tips, but there may be others who do.

I called them for refund and told me it's too late cuz they only have a 7 day window in their policy.  I even asked to at least send me the meals I paid for and consider this an exception to their policy (which  a lot of businesses do for customer satisfaction).  In the end, the supervisor could only give me 50% off credit from the regular price.  My card was charged $39 which was a first time special price, and the current regular price is $60.

I guess first, I'll say I never ever review on yelp as I feel people always have different opinions and experiences at various places so it isn't fair to judge a place on a one time visit. That being said, my visit here was so bad that I felt it necessary to write a terrible review. \nWe can start with my friends and I went to the pool area on a Friday last month and I put my id a credit card down. There was a hold on my card due to previous purchases the week before so they asked for a different card and Id but never gave my stuff back. We were having a good time so I didn't pay it any mind as my friend gave them his stuff and we went on with our day. Well as everyone does in Vegas, we had a really good time, so much so that I forgot to grab my id and cc. No big deal as the people from the pool area contacted me saying they had my stuff and they were holding it for me. I told them I would come tomorrow morning because I was tired and they said no problem, it'll be with lost and found. Well I went downstairs the next morning to find out that they didn't have my id or cc. I had told security that I was contacted by the staff that they had my stuff. Security took no measures to try to get to the bottom of it as I was made by myself to try and figure it out. We found the waitesss that took care of us and she claimed she had given it to my friend when she gave him the bill. That was a lie for 2 reason, 1 being that he never got it and would have given me  my stuff right away and 2, why would they call me and tell me they have it if they gave it back? It made no sense. Well, you can't really do much in Vegas without an id so I was basically screwed the rest of the weekend and my trip was ruined. Next, let's see, we stayed in the palms suits and apparently we couldn't get towels sent to the room without having to pay for them which I thought was the most ridiculous thing I've ever encountered in a hotel. That really pissed me off. \nOn top of all that, I was the one that put my CC down for the safety deposit and long story short, it took me over a month of texting back and forth with the \"property manager\", and a trip to my bank to actually get my money back which was $1,000. And when I say a month, I mean a month to this day! Multiple times I was told the money would be returned with 48 hours and the time went by and got nothing. I was told multiple times that I would be contacted shortly and had to contact her to get a response and literally NOTHING got done to help me out. So I took matters into my own hands, went to chase bank and told them what happened. Took them 2 days to get me my money back. \nI don't know what goes on at this hotel but I spoke to many different people about my issues and got nowhere fast. I work in the hospitality industry and I understand what it's like and that's why I never review on yelp but this is completely warranted. Do yourself a favor and bring your business elsewhere. There are much nicer rooms at decent prices all along the strip in Vegas. Go to any other hotel. This place is absolutely horrible and needs a complete overhaul of staff.\n\nP.s.

BOOO! LOL Anyways back to Maggiano's. It started when we arrived. The hostess was chatting it up with a patron at the bar so we had to wait for her to finish up, now the reason why I am little disturbed as there were two other servers as well as someone who appeared to be a manager standing right by the hostess station. They looked at us, however they did not acknowledge us in the 3 mins we stood there waiting for the hostess to finish her conversation with the patron at the bar. FAIL! \n\nFinally we were acknowledged and we were told where the rest of our party was. We were all seated and about 5 mins or so, drink orders were taken. 15 mins after the orders were taken and we received our drinks,(no I am not over exaggerating either) we get some bread baskets at each table, which was great because we were pretty famished. Fast forward another 15 mins and our appetizers arrived. Now mind you this menu was predetermined days ago so it wasn't like we had to wait for people to order and it was all going to be family style. Now although the appetizers were tasty, we had to wait about another 25 mins after that for the appetizers to be taken away and an additional 20 mins for the lunch to arrive. FAIL! \n\nNow any other time, I would not have a problem if the place was jam packed, but it was not. See what they had failed to mention to us when we arrived is that a water main was broken in front of the restaurant so they no longer had running water. From what I understand, they had brought in more than enough water to get through the lunch rush, but they had called those who had reservations for dinner because they were closing down for the rest of the day due the water main problem. How the hell can you not tell your patrons that you don't have running water and the only way that you find out is because one of your coworkers happens to go to the bathroom and their is someone standing at the door to let you know that there is no running water but there are big coffee pots full of hot water for you to wash your hands however you cannot flush the toilet. WTF??! Great so now we had a better understanding as to why things were taking so long. Had they told us this before hand, I am sure we would have went somewhere else. Especially since we didn't find out until halfway into our meal. FAIL! \n\nMaggiano's I am very disappointed in you today. Our company orders from you quite a bit and I understand that the only discount you gave is that you didn't charge us to take the leftover food back to three coworkers that couldn't make it. Seriously?! Yes I understand that there were circumstances out of your control, but as courtesy you should have told us what was going on and let us decide how to proceed. What should have been a quick 2 hour max lunch turned into a long 3+ hour lunch, which would have been ok any other time had their been working bathrooms.

I looked up this office on my insurance's website and they had 4 doctors listed as doctors who bill to my insurance so I figured I would see one of them once I made my appointment with my new insurance. I mentioned that I had new insurance when I made my appointment and then again when I arrived and filled out the new paperwork. I was seen by a midwife, unbeknownst to me, for my initial appointment and was given the reason that this appointment was just to confirm my pregnancy, after I questioned her not introducing herself as a doctor. \n\nI scheduled my follow up appointment and initial ultrasound without any difficulty related to my new insurance. I came back for my second appointment and mentioned again that I had new insurance. Dr. Dumbo was the physician that saw me at this appointment and she is not one of the 4 doctors listed on my insurance's website as able to bill to my insurance. At the end of my appointment, I questioned her about the billable charges to my insurance and she said they don't bill to my insurance at that location. I told her that I had told multiple different people that I had new insurance and no one mentioned any problems. She said maybe there had been a policy change that she wasn't aware of yet and our appointment concluded. \n\nThree days later, I receive a phone call from the Momdoc billing office stating that I would be responsible for all charges as they can not bill to my insurance from that location. I responded that I should have been made aware of that prior to completing two office visits, initial bloodwork, and an ultrasound. They said it was my responsibility to know where my insurance is accepted. I mentioned the four doctors listed on my insurance website that are assigned to that office location and asked that they resubmit the claim under one of those four approved doctors. They said they can not re-submit the claim under a different doctor than who saw me. They said they bill the midwife visit under Dr. Goodman because he is the managing physician even though I didn't see him and have never seen him and he is not one of the four doctors listed. I told the Billing office that when I had scheduled each of the appointments that I had mentioned I had new insurance and no changes were made to scheduling me with a doctor that could bill to my insurance. I mentioned that I do not feel responsible for these charges as I would not have continued my care with them had they mentioned that they won't assign me to a doctor that bills to my insurance.

Initial meeting went well and we were able to reach a payment that was aligned with our budget. We filled out paperwork and were told everything looks great and left with our new car. Shortly after, we received calls stating the finance department needed more information, totally get it as banks usually ask for additional resources when doing a loan. We worked with Santos and sent in the requested paperwork. We then went to the site itself and filled out paperwork a second time. During this second process, we found that the price of our car completely changed and we were not notified. The gentleman helping us claimed it was because of an error that put a different loan percentage at the start of the process and claimed it had nothing to do with our credit as we both have decent credit and make well over the cost of the car per month. While there, the gentleman we worked with was apologetic and said we should have been notified of the change in price but that there was nothing he could do. My husband and I decided to continue to move forward with the car, as it was only $100 difference and we were able to manage that cost. We signed the paperwork and left with the impression that we were finally done with the financing process. Fast-forward two days later my husband and I begin receiving calls and text messages from random people claiming they need more information. I will note, we both work full time and played phone tag quite a bit during this timeframe. We proceeded to explain that we would send the information to them and asked for contact information but that we would not send personal data via text message. I then made another call back asking if I could speak with someone to find out who we should be sending the documents. I was able to speak with someone who said I should receive a call back. My husband and I both work, so when they called back I was unable to answer.  I received a voicemail from a gentleman claiming that I can call him back at his direct line to get the information to him. Upon returning his voicemail, and repeating what was said on the voicemail, he claimed that he never left a voicemail and I was then yelled at and told that they don't even have record of my account on file. I began to share how disappointed I was in this process and that I was just trying to give the documents they requested and the gentleman was not helpful. I then shared I would just drive back over a third time to drop off the necessary documents. This is completely unprofessional and was not the first time that a man yelled at me on the phone from this location. Thankfully, I finally got in touch with a woman who actually provided information and I was given two emails to send the documents. She and Anthony were the only ones who provided any help during this lengthy process. Again, I am not upset about the required documents, I am upset with the way we were treated by this location. I'm very saddened by this entire experience as we were purchasing a car for our first baby as we just found out we are expecting, and this has tainted the process.

The second time was decent, but our waitress only checked on us once. The last time, today, is very memorable. I ordered some food online to pick up for a friend and myself. I walked into the door and waited next to the hostess area for 6 minutes (I timed it actually). Finally, a man came up to me and asks, \"can I help you with something?\". Okay. Yes I was there for a pick up but he didn't even ask if I wanted to be seated. I tell him, \"I'm here to pick up an order I placed online\", and he goes, \"oh go over to Lindsey she's in charge of to-go\"...

I go to take another bite and bite down on something extremely hard. The pain I felt was excruciating, so I had to spit out the bite to see what was so hard. I look to see what it was and find a small, metallic pebble type thing. I made sure it wasn't maybe a piece of a pit or anything, but this object shined like metal.

Each day I had to follow up with my advisor as I never received any updates, yet the advisor was able to tell me a laundry list of things that I should replace that had nothing to do with why the car was in the shop.

I picked up the car and paid the $600 for a new key.  Got home plugged my lights back in and guess what they worked just fine and have not had a problem since.

Took the car to the Sahara location and they were able to diagnosis the problem it was a faulty EIS which I replaced and have had no problems since.

I can see drive thru cars passing by at a steady pace. Bunch of people inside still no orders delivered. 20 minutes goes by. I ask the manager if they are only serving drive thru tonight. She looks up then away and smartly says were out of steak. What? How do you run out of steak on a Friday night? She then hollers they are cooking more! She never apologised or anything. Her name is Aylssa. She should not be the manager!! A young man by the name of Ernesto came over and tried to calm the situation by offering me a free milkshake. I can't believe I was spoken to so rudely by the manager and then a young man comes over who is not the manager and tries to make it all right. That should have been the managers job! He apologised several times and was trying to make everyone happy. Del Taco, Ernesto should be the manager! He's cool under pressure and all about a happy experience for his customers.

He mentioned that when I got the glass replacement in the mail to bring it into\u200b\u200b the store and they could put it on for me. So today I decided to take in the replacement glass and get it put on. First, I would like to preface by saying that the young woman greeting customers was phenomenal even though the store was busy. We waited awhile and then the associate came up and I said I just need to replace the glass on this phone because it's cracked. As he was walking away I said: \u200b\"This is probably weird but I am a little OCD about things being straight so if you could please do your best and make the glass straight I would appreciate it.\" (I said this because in the past I have had people put these glass screen protectors on crooked and it looks horrible.) He walked away with my phone and then turned and said, \"Well you know you can put this on yourself!\" I was so taken aback that I laughed it off and said: \u200b\"no I am here for you to please put it on for me.\" Then he came back with a smart remark something like \"well, then you get as good as you get.\" Wow, how rude and it made me feel about 2 inches tall.

After she messed  up the paperwork twice we finally got the couches ordered and paid for ($3,600) later we were told they would be ready in 3-4 weeks but most of the time they arrive sooner. About 2.5 weeks went by and I got the call they were in and would be delivered that night. I was thrilled to finally have new couches and so soon! Well at about 8:00 pm we get the call that the couches were damaged and would not be delivered but someone would call us the next day to let us know what would happen. The next day came and no call so that night I called them and customer service had no clue who I was or what was going on so they said they would have someone call me the next day. Next day came and again no call so I called again and again and again and kept getting the run around. 5 days after my couch was damaged a manager finally called me back to tell me the couches could not be fixed but she could send me a photo of the damage they could not fix and if I wanted the couches with the damage they would give me a small discount lol. I laughed and said I just spent 3,600 on a sectional and no thank you I do not want a damaged couch. She said ok and told me my next option was for them to re order it and wait another 3-4 weeks for it to come in. I asked if they could put a rush shipping on them because of everything we had been dealing with and she agreed. Two days later she called and said the couches would be in on September 28th and that she would call the afternoon of to set up delivery. Well fast forward to today September 28th. I didn't get a call or a text about the couch so I once again called and had to talk to two different people to be told the manufacture is planning on shipping the piece today and it would probably be in around the first week of October!!!!!!!

WRONG!!!!!! The piece that was damaged by a driver and needed to be returned is now a different color then the other half of my couch!!! This is real life!! I have waited all this time for couches finally got them and now it looks like I have a checker board for a couch! I reached back out to the person from social media (who has been very nice by the way) and let her know now the couches don't even match and at this point I just want to return them and be done!! I was told I could return them within 7 days but would have to pay a restocking fee of $360.00!!!! I was like WHAT??? I said with everything I have been dealing with for weeks and now a couch that doesn't even match in color the least you could do is return the couches for free  so I can be done with this mess!

At 10:00 when I still had not seen my tracking number on the website with a better indication of when they would be here to pick everything up I decided to call to maybe see if I was given the wrong number. Nope the number was correct the problem was the lady that said she would have them pick up Saturday 8-3 never really put the pickup in the computer. Oh my god! I mean really??? Not sure why I expected the pick up to go as planned when nothing else has! Now it's \"for sure\" scheduled for tomorrow 8-3. Fingers crossed they are going to pick it up.

Stabella is one of the contractors HD uses for their countertops. \n\nTLDR: Keep your correspondences with Stabella so you can dispute any of their false claims and be very careful to check the details, lengths, seams, corners, edges, because they won't be and will try to stick you with broken/incorrect pieces.\n\nFrom the first time Stabella came out to measure, we knew there were going to be issues. The technician made rough measurements, sometimes only measuring once, when it came time to the details, and we asked what he recommended or what most other people chose, he seemed perplexed and unable to clearly answer basic questions about corner radii, edges, or overhang length. My wife had just overseen the buildout of a new space at work where counters were installed (through Lowe's and another contractor) where they measured multiple times, once with the standard tape measure, and again with a computer controlled laser measure system - so we knew that what Stabella was doing wasn't the greatest.\n\nWhen the installers arrived the problems became apparent. They forgot one of the 7 pieces necessary to complete the install (you'd think someone would do a quick count before the order leaves the shop), one of the pieces was cut about an inch too short (going back to the bad measure), two others had noticeable chips in the corners, and in front of the sink was a large, very noticeable chip with a poor attempt at repair, and the sink cutout was cut incorrectly. If you're keeping count, thats 2 of 7 parts that arrived properly. Unfortunately, for us, we didn't notice the sink chip until after the install, luckily, we didn't sign for the completed visit since they forgot a piece. My largest frustration here is that the chipped piece should never have been allowed to leave the shop, once damaged they should have used it for smaller pieces NOT trying to pass it off as new. \n\nNext we reached out to Stabella and Home Depot with pictures of the issues and imperfections. Both responded quickly saying they would look into it and get back to us, both did in a very timely manner - Home Depot taking our side, Stabella remaining stubborn that it wasn't their fault. Here's how that went.\n\nOn the two smaller chips, they said they would fill them in, no problem there. The missing piece, oops, again they would get it fixed. For the part that was cut too short, are we sure we didn't ask the measurer to have it that short? ...seriously, why would we have asked to have 1\" of our cabinets showing, who even says that. \n\nTheir initial take on the chip in front of the sink was that it was part of the manufacturing process and they would just repair it, no problem they said, even their technician who came to do the repairs was perplexed, saying that it was too big to repair and shouldn't have been shipped. \n\nThe sink cutout is where things began to get a bit sketchy. When they came to do the chip repairs, they also measured the sink cutout to see if it was cut wrong. Stabella initially told us they cut it to the size the manufacturer's recommended  size and the shop checked the cutout blank (piece where the sink is) and that it matched what we agreed to. Both of these were clearly lies. Fortunately for us, we had e-mails between us and Stabella outlining exact measurements for the sink, not only that but we requested, and were given the sink cutout. So the part they claimed to have measured was sitting in my garage. \n\nEventually they agreed to recut both incorrect parts and have now installed them, although they chipped one of the existing parts in the process and didn't have paintable caulk to caulk the edges (now that's my project). \n\nOverall, we would never allow Stabella to do another job in our home and are looking forward to having the project done and behind us.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "I've never been here before but I was in a jam yesterday and needed a haircut before a meeting for work.

I stopped into The Joint where the receptionist nearly chased me away. When I got there she asked if I had a regular chiropractor and I said yes. Her response was, \"well, can I asked why you aren't going to that person?\" (I guess the eye roll she gave me came free with the $29 first time visitor fee). After nearly having to plead my case and feeling really unwelcome I did finally get to see the chiropractor and it was helpful (although hardly specialized, I think he spent a total of 3 minutes with me). \n\nPros: They take drop-ins and it's affordable. \nCons: This is sort of the chipotle of chiropractic.

Earlier that day my wife went to the dentist. She was examine and was told to see a doctor right away due to the abscess infection. So we went to  urgent care that afternoon. She was examined and it was  recommended for her to go an ER right away. We went across the street to St.Rose ER. \n\nDuring the 3-5 hour wait in the ER a scan of her face was done. After the long wait  she was simple told that she needs to go see a dentist.. If the ER doctor got a chance to examine her he would would have realize that had already do so and wold have know more about her background with previous bouts of infection. Which she  was previously hospitalized before at St.Rose for the same thing when the infection spread.    \n\nMeanwhile the swelling on face that  ballooned into the size of a basketball and the pain so excruciating she was in tears. There is nothing more heart breaking when your loved one is in excruciating pain and there is nothing you can do to help. she was told she had to \"stick it out\" until Monday. Its like telling someone with a kidney stone attack  to deal with the pain for 2 days with no relief. Thats is very wrong. You go to and ER and at least to get stabilized and relief from pain.  \n\nNo further examination or invasive relief of pain was given to her. Except for a few pill scripts that did absolutely nothing for her. Again if the doctor would have taken the time she would have informed that my wife had a very high resistance to any antibiotics.  She was simply viewed as someone with a tooth ache taking up space in the ER. So she  told there were no beds available in the ER and was sent home just like that. I knew that left untreated her condition would get worst and it did. I called the head nurse in charge at St.Rose and I explained and and I also  asked why would the ER allow a patience get discharged from the ER with no real  exam ,treatment or relief of the pain ? Not allowing the patient to speak to the doctor or allow the patient explain the severity of their  condition.  I explained to the nurse that my wife symptoms got worst the next day. The charge nurse  was very rude and replied with NO real compassion to the situation what so ever. \n\nNever offered to have my wife brought  back to the ER for immediate examination. She also went on to say if we didn't like the way they do things at St. Rose then we should go somewhere else. So that's exactly what I did. I took my wife  to Valley Hospital where she received the best treatment I have yet to see in a Vegas medical setting. To begin with, one look at her excessive swollen face they immediately took her in with Zero wait time !   At Valley they took the time  asked questions and performed invasive treatment to combat the dangerous infection with an IV. Had it not been for Valley Hospital  ER, that infection could easily spread. Maybe even gotten worst  and could have been fatal to say the least. \n\nShame on St.Rose for allowing a total  disregard of patient care to take place in the ER( of all places)  and to have UN-compassionate hospital administrators be rude and obnoxious.

The only reason I came to this dealership was because this particular vehicle was on their lot. The sales and financing process was great from start to finish, the shady behavior began a month later. Below is a full outline of my post-sale experience with the dealership. \n\n4/12/18: As an update to my gleaming 5-star review posted back in March, things got a little shady post-sale. On 3/4/18, I received a notification that a payment was released from my account for the same vehicle I traded in to the dealership on 2/9/18. After speaking with my salesman, he chalked it up to my previous loan service company not disabling auto-pay so I contacted them to let them know. After speaking with the loan care company, they advised that the payoff check for my previous vehicle (the one traded on 2/9/18) had not been received by Keith Hawthorne. I then called Keith Hawthorne again, who told me they would verify with their accounting department when and where the check was sent and I would receive a call back with all that information. Crickets. I waited a day, called the dealership and asked to speak with the individual who was supposed to call me back, she was out of the office so I left a voicemail. The next day, I still had not received a call back from the accounting department so I called again, \"She's not available\", left voicemail number 2. All this time, I'm still following up with the loan service company who continues to advise me that no payoff check has been received. By 3/12/18, I had still heard nothing from the dealership and after viewing their website it appeared the vehicle I traded in had been sold? I found this extremely interesting, because I wasn't sure how a dealership was able to sell a vehicle with an outstanding lien on it, but I digress. Due to my frustration, I sent a detailed email to the General Manager of Keith Hawthorne (because calling was clearly not working). He responded that afternoon, advising he was looking into the matter and would be in touch. As usual, by the next day I still had not heard anything from the GM. I made a call to the dealership, asking to speak with this particular GM, but of course he was \"helping a customer\" but she could take a message. I asked the receptionist when I would receive a return call, she wasn't able to give me an answer so I advised her that I would be glad to get my attorney involved (who was already made aware of the situation when it began) if I wasn't able to speak with someone immediately. She then transferred me to the Sales Manager, who advised me that he located the issue and it would be handled that afternoon. I spoke with the loan service company the next day, who advised they had received the payoff check in the correct amount per the contract I signed in the financing process and I would be issued a refund for the over-payment I made on 3/4/18 but it would take 3-4 weeks. I was content knowing that the issue seemed to be resolved. Fast forward 4/5/18, I still had not received the refund check. I called the loan service company, who advised me they received the payoff check, but then received a stop payment on the original check, followed by another check in a lesser amount than what my initial contract stated. Per the loan service company, the new (lesser) check voided out my reimbursement check. I called the dealership on 4/6/18 with my attorney on the line to speak with the Sales Manager. He said he had no clue why a check for a lesser amount was sent for payoff, but would contact the accounting department. I received a call back from him an hour later where he advised they had my reimbursement check, and were just waiting on the title to be sent from the loan company.

I made the mistake of reaching out to this practice. A day before my appointment, I was given a \"courtesy\" call that my insurance did not have any dental coverage. I was quite certain that this was a mistake, since I have worked for the same company for 8 years and have always had excellent dental coverage. The dental coverage is by DELTA dental. When I explained this to the arrogant secretary that called me, she advised me that Kalons & Glidewell are not accepting new patients that have coverage through DELTA dental. I have never heard of a practice that does not accept a top-rated provider and one of the largest in the country. I asked the lady why, and she explained to me it is because they do not make a profit off of those individuals who have DELTA dental! I was shocked. I have lived in Massachusetts and in California and never encountered a situation quite like this. When I explained my outrage that first of all I was receiving this call just a day before my appointment, it was again snobbishly explained to me that they did not have to call me to give me this information in the first place!\nNice attitude and customer orientation. Finally, I was given the \"option\" to pay out of pocket. How lovely, yet another \"courtesy,\" I suppose! This practice has no interest in new patients and does not contributely positively to the welfare of the community, and I would caution everyone not to be fooled by the other reviews on here, which are of course vague and without much concrete substance.

Enter Waterfront Dentistry...I only went because I \"won\" a free teeth whitening at the Phoenix Bridal Show. I hadn't been worried about the color of my teeth, but it's free so why not? The staff at Waterfront were pleasant enough and there was impressive high tech equipment, but the dentist was very alarmed at how much recession I had in my gums. He said I might need grafting surgery, but he recommended a revolutionary cutting edge treatment that only he does (~$700). And he did not recommend whitening because he thought it would be too painful for me. So I didn't get the whitening, instead, all I acquired was insecurity and fear about my teeth which I'd never had before. I visited my regular dentist a month later and he asked me questions like \"is it bothering you?\" and when I said no, he recommended keeping an eye on it if the recession progresses, but it's nothing to worry about. I've since moved to Oregon and met a new dentist who has confirmed the perspective of brushing carefully, but nothing major is needed at this stage.\n\nMy experience with Waterfront was over 2 years ago now.

As an RN with experience in geriatric psych, I could not believe the conditions there, the way the staff treats the patients (I think inmates would be a better term) The staff is incredibly rude and I watched as a group of women ganged up on another one with threats of physical harm, throwing paper wads, etc. while the supposed \"tech\" didn't even look up from the desk. I had a very good friend there, and after getting several calls during the first 23 hours in the \"Observation area\" I called the facility, was brushed aside, and finally went personally to the facility. I was trying to explain to the \"charge nurse\"  what was going on and what they might say that would help. The nurse visibly rolled her eyes, let out a sigh, and said, \"if I had to hear about the issues of every one of these people and know what to say to all of them..\" I was P.O'd by this point and told her, \"I am a nurse and it IS your job to know what is going on with each of your patients!\" She replied, \"You may be a nurse, but you ain't no nurse here...bye.\" And shut the door in my face. In the name of all that is decent, shut down that hell hole and get some place that at least treats patients and caregivers with some sort of human decency and dignity. It is little more than a cage, or a jail. And if that was the sentiment of the one charge nurse and the inattention I saw in the \"other wing\", which is after the initial 23 hours, I don't have much hope for the rest of the staff.

We often know more about the food than the servers, and we never have a visit to Casa Rasta last less than an hour -- even when our selections are easy, like tacos and burritos.

Each time, the experience has been worse than the one before, which makes me wonder why I go back. The problems with this place begin the moment you walk in the door.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the way that the process works, customers line up down length of the restaurant, order, and are then seated with a number. Employees explained this procedure in the past, but it seems that practice has now been abandoned, resulting in a mishmash of customers that understand this and those that do not. There are individual tables on the sides and a less-desirable community table in the middle. Occasionally, a customer that understands the crummy layout will ignore the system and toss belongings at one of the individual tables before getting into line. This happened last night. We were seated at the community table at specific stools, then asked to move down shoulder-to-shoulder with other customers to make room for incoming customers. This practice of lining up customers as an afterthought at a community table to eat like pigs at a trough needs to stop. \n\nThey were severely under-staffed with a total of three employees working, including the cook. Anyone can see that this place cannot function with only three employees. The staff at the front were frantically trying to juggle managing the line, milkshake-making, seating customers, dealing with complaints, helping in the kitchen, and delivering food to the tables. \n\nMy daughter's burger was delivered a full 20 minutes before mine. The gentleman beside us at the community table, who arrived after us, received his burger before I got mine while his family of 5 had to watch him eat this meal alone. In the meantime, his young children were starving and couldn't understand why their food hadn't come out with their dad's. A second burger was delivered to us, and it was the same one that my daughter had already eaten. My burger finally came out with a cold, too small, soggy bottom bun (typical for Regrub). In an effort to make up for the ridiculous wait, the server brought out an upgraded size of fries. This would have been appreciated, but they were the wrong fries (we had ordered the asiago truffle ones). \n\nIn observing the lone cook in the kitchen, he obviously had no idea how to manage it. This is no wonder because it is not a one-cook kitchen. My daughter has worked in an extremely busy food truck kitchen and she couldn't believe his total lack of a functional system. He had no sense of urgency whatsoever and clearly had no ability to assemble orders in any kind of organized fashion. If you're that behind on your burgers, at least get out the low-prep time food (like fries) to get something in your hungry customers' stomachs. \n\nThis is easily the worst dining experience I've ever had in 20 years living in the Calgary area. \n\nPotential customers: Read the negative reviews because they are an accurate representation of the overall Regrub experience. Forget the hype. This place does not deserve your money. \n\nManagement: Read the negative reviews and use them as an opportunity to improve. Quit setting up your employees for failure by under-staffing the restaurant and leaving your front-facing staff holding the bag when the equally under-staffed kitchen fails them. Give everyone a well-defined role and have them stick to it instead of having them run around overwhelmed and not knowing what to do next.

This was a horrible mistake. Village Sereno Apartments look amazing online. They show many pictures of the inside and poolside areas, which are very nice. However, they neglect to mention safety, poor customer service, poor outdoor lighting, and their fitness center that is only open during business hours. \n     Before signing the lease the staff insisted that the community was crime-free and that the gate was closed during the day. This however was far from the truth. The front gate is open all day, allowing random people to walk or drive through. Within a few months of moving in, our ipad and gps system was stolen from the car while we were unloading groceries! We had left the car unattended for literally less than a minute. I should also mention that this has happened to several of our neighbors, making theft a frequent event a Village Sereno. The community is extremely poorly lit at night and the side pedestrian gate is left unlocked at all hours. Many communities provide keys. \n     There are also more serious crimes at Village Sereno. We have heard gunshots 3 or 4 times since we moved in, one of those being in the field below our balcony. Speaking of community crime, we came home one evening to find a drug-bust happening in our neighbor's driveway... these events do not make Village Sereno a place I want to call home.\n     Noise has also been an issue at Village Sereno. At odd hours of the night it is not uncommon to hear neighbors coming home with their bass up so loud it wakes you up. The neighbor we share a wall with also has this same love for loud music... the mirrors and pictures on my walls shake!\n     The fitness center is also of concern. When we moved in, the staff mentioned that they were re-modeling the fitness center and it was going to have several great machines. Five months later and they still only have a treadmill. But this surprisingly is not even the worst of it. They only allow residents to be in the fitness center if a staff member is present, as it is connected to the main office. If they have to show a unit you have to get out.\n     My experience with the management has been awful. When we moved in, there were several huge black stains on the stairs. It looked as if someone had changed their car oil on the carpet. We asked for another unit, but they didn't have one available so they promised to get it fixed the next day. Well of course this never happened. After asking several times and having no luck, I talked to the manager. She assured me it would be done within the week. Two weeks later, no word from the front office. I called and she forgot all about our conversation. She again assured me that it would be done within a week. I called back and she had forgot again... after talking to the incompetent manager several more times she finally sent a carpet cleaning service out. This was great, but the stains didn't come out. A couple months later after hearing no word from her we finally went to the office and spoke with her yet again... two weeks later now and we still haven't heard from her. This is just one incident. We have made several other complaints and she has not been able to come up with a single resolution.\n     Do not make the mistake of living at Village Sereno. The online pictures may seem great and the staff may seem on top of everything while you are a \"future resident,\" but I am certain your views will change after you move-in.

My car was \"fixed\" for a week, then the check engine light came back on and I went back to have more work done. $500 later, everything seemed to run smoothly. They even said that they \"gave me a break on the labor.\" I was so grateful!\n\nLast week, my car showed signs of the SAME issue happening again. 8 months later. On a car with 40,000 miles on it. I took it to another mechanic who ran a diagnostics test (for free) and confirmed that it was indeed the same issue. When he was done replacing the parts, he kept the old ones to show me: they absolutely had not been replaced and were completely falling apart. \n\nI was tempted to drive over there with my bag of parts and my receipts, but I know that they will just give me the run around.

I paid $2800!!! for a Surface book that I ended up returning cause it's way over priced and the managers returned the computer but still billed my Dell preferred account $2800 dollars and gave me only $21 back of the $233.92 I paid cash. What the heck ?? And the manager was clueless and said they'll mail you a check! I asked where is my proof and receipt? He said there is none. Wow and that's your managers response? That is not how you handle a customer the spends $3000. I am not purchasing a toy, this should be a profession company who offers reliable support. So I waited a few days for the credit to go back and waited and waited until I realized I never got a receipt emailed to me. I've don't several returned and ever single time I received a receipt via email. So my suspicion rose and I called Dell and they told me No Mr. Cholak your credit balance is not clear and you owe us $2800!!!! So I call Microsoft and they said ok ok we'll email you a receipt. Still got nothing!!  So now I'm at a point where I returned a $2800 pc from Microsoft and I'm STILL getting billed for the full amount and not one manager or Microsoft representative gave a crap. I called Dell EVERY SINGLE day asking for a damn refund asking what is the problem. Oh and let's not forget I already called the chandler location countless times, I went to the store twice and every time they said oh it's Dells fault. So I called Dell for 3 weeks I probably spent a total of 10hours on the phone, because nobody at that location can take care of a customer and show some ownership. I finally started having Dell call out to the chandler store now because they asked me to EMAIL them The RECEIPT!!! Hahahaha what!!!

Not one response from Microsoft, no apology for the inconvenience. They actually ended up telling Kevin ( Dell corporate escalation) that we are sorry, we messed up so bad that we cannot fix it. So Dell had to eat the whole thing and issue a credit to the cover the amount. The moral is nobody at the chandler location helped. I called Dell so many times and fixed it myself.

When I first moved into my apartment, I had a bug problem. Cockroaches would come out of the bathtub, out of the sinks, and little bugs would be on the counter every evening. I was only able to resolve this by spraying every evening straight for a week. Disgusting.\n\n3.) they call this a gated community. The gate on Central is never working. If they do fix it, it works for two days. Do not consider this a gated community if you move in. What's the issue with this?

The fact that my dryer has broken five times during my lease, they must not be fixing it right and won't replace it. I've had my clothing destroyed because of issues with my dryer. \n\n7.) My electricity bill is astronomical due to improper ventilation. The ceiling boards appear to have a molding issue and cracking.

The supermarket had very limited selection of groceries and some of the products were a bit more expensive than those in other markets in GTA.  Still, I thought it was a good place to go because it was good for browsing many different Japanese products in one place and the beauty shop carries some good Japanese beauty products that I can rarely find in any other places.\n\nHowever, I will NOT go there EVER AGAIN because I had very unpleasant experience a few days ago when I had katsu meals with my husband at the restaurant, which is next to Heisei supermarket.  I do not know when the restaurant is closed but, when we ordered the meal, it was around 3:30 in the afternoon, which I thought is not too late to have lunch and, as Google says J-town closes at 7:00 p.m., I thought we would have enough time to have the meals. \n\nWhen we got our meals, it was around 3:40 p.m., and 5 minutes later, the staff came out of the kitchen and started lifting up the chairs and putting them on the table.  I do not know what was going on at that time but I could not believe my eyes when I saw the staffs started sweeping the floor next to my husband and me who just started eating the meals.  \nI watched the staffs to figure out what was really going on and it seemed like they were cleaning the restaurant before closing.  What was even worse was that I had to have my meal smelling the very strong cleaning detergent all over the restaurant.  No one did not care about us and the staffs just mopped the floor, which made me feel like I was having a katsu drizzled with detergent.  We had to jam all our meals in our stomach very quickly because we felt a kind of pressure that we should leave the place right away or shouldn't have ordered the meals in the first place.  IF they really had to clean the restaurant while we were having lunch, I still do not understand why no one told us that they were going to close very soon or they might have to start cleaning the restaurant during our meal.

For example, we took the monorail to the very north end, which on the monorail map, appeared very close to Circus Circus, for the kids to to play some games, but because the monorail drops you so far on the outskirts from the stop, we had to take a cab from monorail to circus circus.

SUpposedly have \"always been doing it\" but never encountered it until this week in Peninsula--maybe the wait staff, being customer-oriented, have been evading this ridiculous policy. How many other restaurants do this? It is illogical; dressing for salads is like ketchup for fries, and some people use more while others use less, but no one is charged by the oz. Salsa is like ketchup for chips and mexican dishes. Their policy is not even internally consistent: hog up the ketchup and BBQ sauce for free if you want, but get out your checkbook if you actually want to see sauce on your buffalo wings. Suggest that others annoyed by this also rant, and better still, complain to the managers. As for me, I'm cutting back on my usual weekly visits and boycotting their salads.\n\nThe rest of the review: One of  a local chain, this branch is located in the scenic Cuyahoga Valley in a cute & tiny town. Lots of atmosphere in its old roadhouse setting. Occasional live music. Bar is active and loud--not a good place for conversation (or families unless they like lots of stimulation). Come between lunch and dinner hours if you want a quieter environment (though hostesses tend then to push guests to sit in the bar whether one wants that or not; assert yourself to get the eating ambiance you prefer).\n\nNice little patio but not a particularly scenic one given it's right on the parking lot. Lines can get long in the summer on weekends (Fishers across the street is a good alternative if you don't want to wait). SItting in the front window area is best if you are interested in scenery and local color.\n\nFood is consistent and of good quality, but not always a good value in terms of pricing. Lunch and dinner specials are the best values. Much of the food I'd describe as basic bar food, although there are some excellent (if perhaps overpriced) salads. Their BBQ sauce is popular hereabouts and superior to national chains, but not really authentic pit-style BBQ. Excellent beer selection--a strength. Burgers are basic, flavorful and large but lacking the extra touches like toasted buns. Nice menu variety--something for everyone (although not so much for vegans). Staff are friendly and helpful but service can sometimes be variable. \n\nNote: To be fair, however, I would consider some of the reviews posted here to be overly critical and not representative of my typical experience here.

My boyfriend's was gonna be $46, and he said okay, but to make It strong, and they absolutely did. The bartending got this place an extra star. It took a very long time for them to come out, which makes sense given our special request, but once they did (we could see them sitting at the server counter from our seats), our server passed by them three times without grabbing them until we flagged her down. \n\nWe got steak and chicken fajitas, and the steak was more medium-well than medium-rare, and I didn't care for it much. The chicken had good seasoning and was cooked properly, so that was better. My boyfriend got the trio dish which came with a chicken enchilada (okay-basically a pile of mush without much flavor), a pork tamale (disgusting . . . really disgusting. It looked identical to the enchilada, but I can't even describe how gross it was), and a mini taco (okay).  \n\nThey forgot our corn tortillas and we asked or server, but then forgot and we had to remind her again ten minutes later once we could finally flag her down.

Happy to be served, but that was pretty chaotic.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend visiting the bar, only, and maybe even pass on the chips and salsa, since I don't feel they're really worth the $3.

Great concept!  The woman inside was very nice and helpful in explaining the program to me.  I bought 3 meals to take home and try:  Butternut Pork, Forbidden Chicken and Herb Roasted Chicken.  The pork and the Herb Roasted Chicken both came with the same vegetables; carrots and zucchini.  \n\nMy honest opinion??  Not good.  Even with BBQ sauce on the chicken and the veggies...I did not enjoy.  The chicken had a strange 'old' taste and the veggie had no detectable seasoning on them.  They were very bland and strangely, seemed to have absorbed whatever the strange 'old' taste was from the chicken.  The pork had the same weird taste and bland veggies.  I did not enjoy this either.  \n\nThe broccolini and rice from the Forbidden Chicken meal were ok.  But the chicken was the exact same as the Herb Roasted, same exact seasoning.  Again, did not enjoy.\n\nI feel confident that the other meals must be better than these because if they all tasted this way, noone would eat here.\n\nAgain, I love the concept, and the woman inside was very nice.  I think the prices are ok too, provided the food is fresh, seasoned and enjoyable.

I came here shortly after opening so I was expecting a super clean restaurant, but many of the empty tables were dirty with crumbs and food still on them. The drink station was far from clean and organized. The bottled drinks at the register were half emptied, the floor felt sticky under my table, and the guy at the register didn't look all that clean himself. He looked rather frumpy.\n\nOrdering was easy and quick. I ordered the Avocado Bacon Club and was asked if I wanted it beef, chicken, turkey or black bean. I decided on the chicken and to have it grilled instead of crispy. I got this with everything on it. I also ordered a side order of fried pickles. My guest got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with the Smashfries. Our food probably only took about 7-10 minutes before it was out to us. Everything looked great, but that is as far as the \"great\" went. My biggest disappointment was the fried pickles. They were beyond too salty and they were sitting in a pile of oil..gross!! The sandwich was decent as the bread was good, lettuce was crispy, but the avocado was turning dark and the chicken piece I got in my sandwich was super thin, about the thickness of a deli lunch meat slice. Very disappointing, especially since the sandwich was small, to begin with. \n\nMy guest's sandwich was good, nothing special about it. Said it tasted like the same kind of quality you could have gotten at McDonald's or Burger King and for half the price. Again, the side was very disappointing. The Smashfries were nice and crispy, but they lacked flavor. They had hardly any rosemary on them and I definitely couldn't taste any garlic on them. As you got to the bottom of the pile of fries, they also were sitting in a pile of oil. So sad as I have memories of other Smashburger locations being on point with their food. I probably will not come back to this location again. \n\nWhen we were finished eating, I wanted to clean up after us and throw our trash away, but I guess they have someone come around and get the dirty trays after people leave as there were no trash cans out for the customers. Kind of frustrating for me as I like to clean up when I'm done eating. \n\nThe one guy that was working the front was very friendly.

The burgers were the best of the lot, made with an excellent quality beef patty, delicious cheese and a tender bun.  The sliced turkey was god-awful horrid.  It clearly wasn't carved from anything resembling a real bird, but was some type of formed meat buried under a half cup of salty canned gravy.

The menu looked promising and I could immediately tell there was an Indian flair as it smelled like samosas (too bad they weren't on the menu though!).  I had the baked eggs with ground beef.  It tasted somewhat weird.  I thought it would be an egg scrambled that was baked, but it was 2 cracked eggs (one yoke was still somewhat runny), some ground beef, cilantro and parmasean cheese on top.  It wasn't really a combination that I would have thought of, but I like to try different things at restaurants and figured they had put some thought into the mixture, but it just tasted so random.  It came with \"HM and toast\".  I asked what HM was and was told that it meant \"homemade\" which didn't really make sense.  Turns out it was (sweet potato) home fries - which were the best part of the meal.  \n\nMy friend got the creamy crepes.  The waitress couldn't tell us what made them creamy though.  Inside was strawberry, grapes, yoghurt or some sort of whipped cream maybe, and...avocado.

I've waited ages and ages for food, even during non peak hours. \n\nThe last time I ate here, they forgot one of our drinks, forgot to put dressing on the side of a salad, and then when the brought out the remade salad undressed, they didn't bring any dressing on the side, I had to ask three times for salt (we sat outside and there wasn't any on the table), and had to ask twice for simple syrup for my iced tea. Some of these were special requests, but a restaurant like this should be able to handle that. \n\nOne of the strange things was that there were a total of 5 different people that came to the table. I'm sure this contributed to the inconsistencies we endured. \n\nIt's such a shame because the food here is actually really good.

My platter did not include guacamole and included a very small sprinkling of pico de gallo instead. The server said they were all out of guacamole. All out of guacamole at 12PM on a weekday in a Mexican restaurant? WTF! First red flag.\n\nThe rice was atrocious. Pretty much inedible. It looked nothing like the rice pictured in other Yelper's reviews. The previously pictured rice looks orange-coloured (with spices, presumably) and is loose on the plate. The rice I was served was clumped in a small mound and it was the colour of rice pudding. It pretty much had the consistency of thick rice pudding, but unfortunately without the pleasant flavour of rice pudding. So it was off-white, sticky, almost flavourless, clumpy dreck. Frankly, I don't know how you could do worse to rice. \n\nThe refried beans were so far from refried beans it was almost laughable. I don't know whether they just decided to stretch out last night's refried beans by adding a whole potful of bean water to them, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's what they did. The beans were closer to bean soup than refried beans. Beans are not expensive; you do not need to cheap out and water them down so much.\n\nThe seasoned shredded pork was decent, but it was served lukewarm rather than warm or hot. I tried my dining companion's pork carnitas and these were not pork carnitas. This was just shredded pork without the seasoning. Carnitas are chunks, not shreds. And carnitas are more tender than the rather dry shredded pork I tried off my dining companion's plate.\n\nI'd love to have a go-to local Mexican joint, but this doesn't look like it's going to fit the bill when you factor in the guacamoleless state of a Mexican restaurant, the watered down soupy beans, the weird clumpy rice, and the lukewarm proteins.

We were waiting for French toast, the toast with mozzarella and roasted tomato and toast with fig jam and mascarpone cheese. Perhaps the wait was long because they were roasting tomatoes? If that's the case, there should be a tiny disclaimer. Secondly, the French toast, in my opinion, was not worth $8.50. The bread wasn't especially thick. You can get just as good for cheaper at Over Easy. I also think $3 for tea is a bit overpriced. Maybe they have to do that to make a profit for organic ingredients or special beverages.

Instead, the servers (and I don't mean just one but I mean all of them) hover over your table giving you the impression that they want you out of there. This is not good service on any calculation. It is not attentive at all but rather annoying.  Amanda, one of the servers, must have been either bored or not focused, because all she did was swish past the tables about every 1-2 minutes. It was so annoying that we started to time it and sure enough she went by again and again and again. It was as if she was on ice skates--or perhaps even more so was trying to get someone's attention.   NOT attentive but rude.  The others were abrupt in their interactions with us and frankly not very helpful. One of them just starting ripping all the glasses off the table when it was obvious we were in deep conversation. Back off! She just came up and interrupted our vibes at the table by reaching deep into the table to get all glasses. Was Postino's short of glasses? Really? This is beyond abrasive.\nI can not complain about the food since we enjoyed the food and the beer and the wine.  But I can complain about the service and lack of manners and lack of sensitivity to your customers. I want to emphasize that this complaint is only directed at Postino's Arcadia.

I couldn't even finish it despite the price because it was so filling and it was so dense. Service was definitely lacking. We had to wait forever (40 min) for our food which was served cold to us. When we were done we had to wait another 30min for our bill and for the machine. Our waitress saw us gave us eye contact and nodded, I assumed she'd come and check up on us.

Yeah, whatever. \n\nSo after that, we went down to the front desk to even more horrible customer service (also while packing up my stuff, I noticed that the last person's dirty socks were under the bed). No sorry! None! NO SORRY, whatsoever. Just an annoyed sigh, and head nod, some bitchiness, and a new room key.

They've been extremely loyal customers for over 20 years, I'm 23 just to put it in perspective. My family has never ever owned any other kind of car. In fact they get a brand new toyota every 4 years like clockwork from this dealership.\nNow, we went to the dealership knowing exactly what car we were interested in. It was listed for $7,000 with 120,000 miles on it. Of course the dealership had it looking gorgeous, it test drove perfectly and we bought it. I really couldn't believe they were asking $7,000 for a car with that many miles on it and they would not budge, on top of which we were told that there was no way to purchase a warranty with the vehicle because of its age/amount of miles. We'll now I know why.\nA week after I drove it home, I was leaving work one Sunday afternoon and my car wouldn't start. Mind you, my place of work is like 3 miles from where I live, and bell road toyota is like right smack dab in the middle. I take very good care of my car as well. I towed it to the dealership and luckily the service manager took a look under the hood even though I was supposed to have to wait until Monday. The problem ended up being the after market starter not fitting properly into the engine the way a factory starter would? They fixed it free of charge and showed me how to fix it should this happen again in the future. Luckily this hasn't been an issue since. \nHOWEVER, this is where it all goes awry... A few weeks after this, mind you, barely a month after buying the car, when turning my steering wheel it started making this squeaking noise, like rubber on rubber. Being a young female driving a 13 year old car, I just thought it was a normal sound to be made, considering the steering wheel is made of rubber. So the car was not seen other than for its regular oil lube and filter. Then there were a good two months when the car sat in my parents garage in their possession not being driven at all! So I get it back and just last week, after maybe 4 months of actual use, my car just stopped working. The accelerator wouldn't work, the car started driving in this jerky stop and go fashion. So that's what I took it in for to be fixed. That gets fixed and then it gets test driven, when the service guy hears that squeaking rubber noise from my steering apparatus.... Come to find out the power steering is shot from basic \"wear and tear\" and it's basically $2,000 to fix it... If I had that kinda money, I would've just spent more when I came here to buy a car 6 months ago. Yes, this is all within 6 MONTHS. I'm beyond livid that I'm now making payments on a car I can't drive because it's sitting at the dealership until I can afford to fix it. I don't know how these dealership people sleep at night.

The bread wasn't sliced open fully, more like sliced to make a pocket in which a minimal amount of thin sliced steak (which was tasty) was crammed, and about a half a head of shredded lettuce was jammed into (which mostly fell out) it. The tomatoes were cut like someone had done it with a butter knife and were on top of my fries, (this is not due to carrying the bag, I was careful) There was no onions anywhere, nor mayo, or any condiments at all. \nI got the combo, and my fries were really, really really really salty... once I had a bite of one I immediately had to have a sip of root-beer that was included in my meal. I can't be for certain because I took one sip and immediately spit it out as my soda tasted like someone hooked a liquid soap dispenser to the soda fountain. \n\nBetween part of my sandwich having been missing, overly salty fries, putrid fountain soda, no napkins and slow sloppy service ( I didn't include that part of my experience, but when you see a customer walk into your spot, you should think about greeting them and asking if they've been served) I'm really not sure how this place stays in business.

Ironically, the last 1/2 inch was all head, so it wasn't even actually filled that high... and it was labeled .25L, which would be 250ml.  Later we noticed that in addition to being short of the .25, the menu actually said it was a 300 ml pour, so we were really shorted!  At $6.50 a glass for the equivalent (when actually filled to the line) of 8.4 oz, that's a $13 glass of beer for a typical 16 oz pint!\n\nMy sangria tasted good, but watered down.  It could have been the ice in the wine glass or the Sprite, but I don't think I've ever had Sangria without fruit in it!\n\nWe got a beet and avocado salad, and that was really good.

I've been searching for more of a Thai style Tom Kha Gai and I literally searched through all Yelps of the Thai places in Vegas to find one similar to Lao Thai Kitchen which changed owners.\n\nI finally decided to try Ocha's version for lunch with some friends based on the photos I saw.\n\nFirst of all the restaurant is huge. It was actually pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated promptly and there was one server. \n\nThe price points are average for Thai food in Vegas. The dishes were on average $11-$12 which is okay. There's some cheaper places and some more expensive.\n\nThe place wasn't so nice inside as the table was all beat up with some sharp areas you'll have to be careful of.\n\nWe got pad thai which was good but nothing special. Not the best but most the worst. On the plus side it did stay nice and moist. \n\nWe got Thai beef salad which was okay. It really just tasted like it was dressed with lime juice. It was really one note. There was pretty much just lettuce and some beef slices. \n\nLast we got the Tom Kha Gai. It was not good. I know that Laos and Thai people all make it different and I've had this soup many times. I've heard of the sour flavor from the soup coming from lime or tamarind. This place definitely used tamarind and it was super sour and super salty. You couldn't taste any spice just salt and sour. The portions of chicken and mushroom in here were generous though. I can't say that about the pad Thai or beef salad though.\n\nMy two positives were that they gave us a generous serving of white rice & I believe the sticky rice was on the house. That reminds me their rice was not good. Sometimes you just want plain old white rice and they definitely didn't use jasmine rice. Otherwise it was not cooked well because it was dry.\n\nOverall our lunch kind of was lame. Service was slow as our server was pretty slammed so we were barely checked on.

Personally, I'm not a fan of either mackerel or bluefin tuna (mackerel is just to \"fishy\" for me and this bluefin tuna was .... blah) so I asked for something else. I was a bit upset to see that mackerel was one of their top selection, but I was willing to pay the extra money ($5) to get a different assortment. It came back with a beautiful serving of hamachi (yellowfin) and whitefish with a prawn on top. Yum! Definitely what I was hoping for in the first place. While the spread was nice, the sashimi itself was fairly... blah. Not buttery soft salmon, no melt in your mouth hamachi. It was alright, but I don't think I'd order it again. \n\nAll in all, we had a good time at this restaurant.

When I go to a sushi place, I want to see the chef's super duper fancy rolls. Sabi's menu was very lacking in this regard and the menu was made up of pretty \"meh\" rolls. We ended up ordering a Dragon roll, California roll, and Phili roll. Oh, and one other thing I have to say is that the draft beers are a varied selection and come at a cheap price.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of fried calamari (one of my weaknesses). Sabi's calamari is fried in a tempura batter and served with plenty of pepper and a spicy sauce. I've never had fried calamari tempura-style, and I never will again. It's a heavy coating and proved to be too heavy for the calamari as I tasted more fried goodness than seafood. I have nothing against fried food, but I'm extra judgemental of calamari and the lack of taste was sad. In it's defense I have to say that the sauce was pretty good and complimented the tempura well.\n\nThe rolls were average, if not a little below. They were very \"ricey\" so they were heavier than what I'm used to in sushi rolls. The California roll was pretty bland, even with the extra fish they layer on top. The Dragon roll was my favorite of the three but it was still nothing that blew my mind. As for the Phili roll...we haven't had that in quite a number of years. I guess we felt that we \"graduated\" beyond such \"beginner rolls\". Yet with such a blah menu where nothing really jumped out at us, we decided to have a blast from the past with the Phili. It was ok, but nothing special.\n\nI think my biggest problem with Sabi is that it just doesn't stand up to other restaurants I've been to.

They are more about selling you services and units but when I needed them to check a noise in my AC and the AC stops working during tinkering around with it they blame the thermostat that they installed in the first place. This is the short version, I sent the. A letter through their face book page for what really happened and I have yet to hear back from them. You wonder how this company is being managed.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "This is a long overdue review.\n\nI traveled to Pittsburgh on a week-long business trip. Given that I prefer peace and quiet when not in meetings and social events, this seemed like a great situation. As many other reviewers have said, this hotel is very much hidden away, with a great team of very courteous staff. Unfortunately, many other factors ultimately made this a very average stay despite the staff.\n\nLet's start with the good. When I first checked in, front desk manager Michelle was extremely friendly and checked me in promptly. In addition, my request for a fridge and microwave involved only a one-time charge of $10, which is more than reasonable. The hotel shuttle staff was great too. Although officially, their shuttle is for airport transportation only, but they offered to drop me off at Robinson Town Center to be picked up later so that I can do some shopping. For the entire duration of my stay, it was rather hassle-free.\n\nNotice that the only positives I pointed out relate directly to this hotel's service. That's because the level of comfort is simply not there. Despite the great service, the staff obviously has to make do with what they got. And what they got here is an old hotel building in a bad situation. First, the room I stayed in was particularly damp. Granted, the week of my stay also happened to be rather humid. But when I put on my dress shirt that was hung in their closet, it felt wet! That level of humidity inside a room is absolutely absurd. Second, the air conditioning was extremely loud, and not entirely functional either. Though I could have raised this to the management's attention, but I chose not to because it wasn't intolerable and I don't think there's a short term fix for it. Third, the hotel wifi, although free, is very slow. I believe it was outsourced to a third party provider named Ethostream. Perhaps due to the age of the hotel, no ethernet corded online service is provided to the rooms. This made getting work done in the evenings after a day of meeting extremely difficult, as my company uses cloud storage solution for many shared documents. The fitness center contained two treadmills, two ellipticals, one recumbent bike, and a set of free weights ranging from 5 lbs up to 50 lbs. Curiously, 30 lbs weights were missing. One of the ellipticals is badly in need of replacement or repair. The room is cooled by a wall-mounted A/C unit with a non-functional ceiling fan. Courtesy towels and water cooler is provided for cleaning and hydration. There's also one single wall-mounted LCD TV. In other words, the fitness facility here is rather barebones. Speaking of LCD TV, hotel rooms are equipped with old tube TVs. So if you watch a lot of TV, you'd get disappointed. When the A/C kicks on, your TV volume will need to be raised up to at least 50% for audibility. Going back to the level of humidity. My bed felt somewhat damp too, perhaps partially due to the fact that the hotel is surrounded by small hills that tend to trap moisture in humid environments. And speaking of location...\n\nSo, the hotel wasn't always \"out of the way\". The staff told me that once upon a time, the Pittsburgh Airport was much closer. After moving the airport, they also eliminated a highway exit ramp that used to lead directly to the hotel. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the Pittsburgh taxi service is atrocious. You can't prearrange pick-up with taxi drivers either, as they are not allowed to arrange fares for themselves. Every taxi fare MUST go through a central dispatcher due to union rules. What that translates in to is that when you need a taxi, you absolutely must call ahead. Even if you do, chances are they will be late to pick you up.\n\nAll in all, the staff was tremendous. They are absolutely making the best out of a bad situation for the hotel. The hotel is old, and inconvenient as far as accessibility is concerned. Despite the great service I received, there's only so much the staff can do when the physical environment is so challenging. So I can't honestly recommend this hotel for any extended duration of stay. However, I can certainly see how this may be a great park-stay-fly situation.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "C'est peu la jungle l\u00e0-dedans durant les grandes ventes.

It was at a very busy intersection during rush hour and drizzling so I was trying to get the guy's info as quick as I could.  I was nervous to get his license plate number because all of the angry drivers flying by swerving around us, I was sure I was going to get hit by on coming traffic.

However, somewhere betwen when I dropped the car off at the claim center and where they fix it, there was a major problem!  My car had been completely gone through.  By the quick glance I gave the car, I didn't notice anything was wrong.  So, I go on my way.  \n\nFirst, when I started driving I noticed that a coule of small things that were in the center console were on the tray in front of my cup holder.  I went to put them in the console and notice that all of the change in the bottom of the console was gone!  I had change (not my life savings but a significant amount) in the botton of my console which is quite deep and has enough things on top of that you would have to remove all of it to even see the change, ALL of the change was gone.  I mean every penny!  Again not my lifes savings but it was mine. \n\nSecond, I noticed that my dash panel (where my deck and DVD player is) was cracked on the passenger side, like someone tried to take it off but failed.  \n\nThird, when the company called for a follow up on the service I explained all of the things that were wrong with my car, she said she was sorry and that managers are aware of the issue that they are having and she said its because they think it's the people that live in the surrounding apartments jump the fence and go through the cars and I'm not the only person that this has happened to.  Not to mention, she sounded a little irratated that I even mentioned the issues.  \n\nReally Progressive?  That's the answer.  You're sorry and managment is aware of the issues?  How about you lock the cars that you park on the lots where you store the cars!  That should be a requirement!

I was told it was billed \"in error\" after having to file a grievance with Delta Dental; Still, the office has never sent in a correction to Delta Dental (even to this date).

I was told that I needed, at most, a two surface filling on tooth #18.  The cost difference was about $371 after insurance.  I had the two surface filling done at another dental office and I have not experienced any discomfort or issues.\n\nBecause of the discrepancies on my EOBs and the conflicting second opinion, I no longer feel comfortable DOING BUSINESS WITH this practice.

As for the meal, we made it easy for the server, we each got the valentine menu (90USD, so not cheap again) even though the restaurant still offered their regular menu (which probably cost less too).\n\nWhen the first plate arrived, presentation looked nice. So I was excited because at this point we were so hungry. However, I got excited too early. The food was cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile. First course, we ordered was the bone marrow. It  was tasteless; not seasoned well. Second course, the best course of all, was the lobster ravioli. This dish was salty but it had fresh chunks of lobster and at least it wasn't soggy. Third course was the medium rare steak. I'm a huge fan of steaks but this steak was so tough and chewy that I lost interest in it. Lastly, is the dessert. It is a trio but only one out of the three was yummy. \n\nBecause the server was so out of it and our friends were in a rush to a show, we didn't say or complain about it. Since it was on Valentine's day, it was even more disappointing. I'm just glad the busser for our table that day was friendly. I do not understand how this restaurant has such a high rating.

I was soooo looking forward to trying it out and having a wonderful experience but I ended up short. Our waiter was very attentive in the beginning but then he got distracted by a party of girls who either had too much to drink or were just normally extremely outgoing and forward with their conversation. In any case, they were chatting and chatting and chatting and stiiill chatting by the time we had finally set our menus down because we were tired of waiting to order. Their chat probably went on for a good 10-15 minutes in front of our table without our orders having been taken. I didn't worry about it too much but by the end, I was getting frustrated. I know our waiter was probably giving us time to review the menu, but it still seemed a little excessive. Once we ordered, our food did not take too long to arrive but it was definitely mediocre and did not give off a fresh taste. I asked for my food to be prepared spicy and that request was accommodated. We had a restaurant.com coupon and I gave it to our waiter prior to his preparation of our bill. I did not realize a certain percentage of tip was automatically included in the bill until I went to add the tip myself. It appears they automatically added 18%. Now, this is annoying to me. I know some people may not tip properly but I am a regular 20%+ tipper and while our service was not exactly stellar, I probably still would have left a very generous amount (on the full bill, not just the discounted price). Needless to say, I did not add any additional tip to our bill. Don't think I'll ever be going back to this place- not necessarily because the food or atmosphere is bad, but just because the food is not worth the money (you can get similar tasting food at a cheaper Indian buffet place) and the service wasn't the best.

However what this review is really about is the quality of their hookah - they had raised prices since the last time I'd visited, and anywhere in Vegas charging $30 for a head of hookah that only lasts 15 minutes before getting tasteless and harsh, can suck it. Apparently their prices are now $20 for a head and $10 for refills, which is moderate, but unless they've changed the hookah I've never had it last long enough to be worth the $.\n\nFrom my experience, it's either love or hate. I've never met anyone to say that Nu was \"okay\" - but have certainly heard my sentiments echoed by many of my friends after their own terrible experiences (one friend, after making reservations a week in advance, was forced to wait 45 minutes for a table.

This lady rolled her eyes at everyone that didn't want to take a picture or she would rub her face in frustration and give an upset look at the sky the moment you would ask to not have your picture taken. As if that wasn't enough she mistreat kids, probable she has never been around little kids enough to know kids are impatient, so when my nephews were trying to go in she pushed them back and popped her eyes at them thinking nobody saw her and asked what were they doing, to go back with their parents!

I didn't say anything to her because I thought ok, she doesn't like kids running around or just trying to follow safety rules, I don't know, I guess I was just trying to find an excuse for her behavior.

Customers are the ones that feed you and why you keep your job. Customer should be your #1 priority and your job is to serve them and make them feel good about the service you provide them. If you cannot do that, then that is not the job for you.

But I could only afford the 900 dollar set. She tries to tell me about financing so we tried that I was not approved. Then she tried to sell me half of the set for the more expensive one but I needed the set. Then I face timed with my husband and I guess this made her feel weird because after I hung up and I guess she found out I was gay her attitude changed telling me if I want the low budget stuff in the back that's fine but she needs to get to other customers. So after so weird type chat I wound go into detail she gets my paper work ready as we are walking to the payment area some other people walk-in and she tops to talk to them and then turns to me and says \"your sale got me a Happy meal I'm going to take care of them so I can make some real money\" handed me my paper work and told me to take up there my self. I never felt so low in my life I tried to get the couch she wanted to sell me but I just couldn't.

We had high hopes that the new owners of this previously great gym would make some innovative changes that would help turn this place into a world class Acrobatics/Gymnastics/Circus gym. Unfortunately, that is not what has happened. First...I don't feel like the gym is as clean as it should be, but that's easy enough to fix. The biggest problem in my eyes, is the attitude of the management. When we went, I felt like we were being almost \"looked down upon\" for taking advantage of the gym's open house-free class for kids. As far as I'm concerned, if you don't want people to come try out a free class at your gym to see if the parents feel like it's a good fit, price is within their budget, the safety is up to par, the coaches mesh with their kids, and the child seems excited and interested enough to attend and engage in classes...then don't give a free class! \nI felt that I was \"expected\" to sign up with no questions asked. Once I started asking questions, I felt talked down to by the woman whom I later found out was the owner/manager. I went in thinking... \"maybe if my child likes this class enough we'll invest in month or two\" and I left knowing I'd never pay to send my child to this gym. High point was the instructor/coach of the class my Son tried. He was so personable with the kids. He really made it fun for my Son. At this point he is no longer working at this gym.

When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\n\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\n\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \n\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \"I don't know.\"  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\n\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\n\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \"Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\"Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\n\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \n\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip.

After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards.

Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday!

The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together.

They never called me with status updates (even when they told me they would), I had to call them. I even sat in their shop the day they said it'd be ready (for five hours) and was appalled to hear them on the phone ordering parts for my car that they knew I needed more than a week prior. They gave me back my car with trash and spare parts in the front seat, and a dead battery. And despite replacing the radiator, not even a month later, the radiator hose needed to be replaced.\n\nHere is what happened to my car:\n\nI had a 2000 Chevy Blazer. One evening I was driving home and I heard something pop. I thought it was another car blowing a tire, but I got home and heard a sound like something was frying under the hood of my car. I had my car towed to their shop Monday morning (I used my insurance company's free towing service) because the next day I was flying to DC for a business trip and I figured it was a blown gasket and would take several days to repair. A few hours later I received a call from the shop, explaining that a hose had blown and something about a thermostat censor and the cost of parts and labor would be about $600 and my car would be ready that afternoon. I told them to go forward with the repairs.\n\nA few hours later, I get another call and now I have a blown gasket and a rusted radiator and the repairs will take four days and the new cost is $1600. I protested the radiator because I just got a new radiator not even two years ago. I was accused of putting water in the radiator, causing it to rust, but I don't even know how to do that. I can't even refill  my washer fluid because I'm too short to reach that far under the hood. I was told I wasn't being charged anymore for labor, just the extra parts. I needed my car back, and I was in no position to buy a new one, and I know blown gaskets are usually $2500 minimum to repair, so I told them to proceed.\n\nI eventually got my car back after 15 days (eight days after they originally said it'd be ready) and the bill was $1600 like originally promised so I paid. My passenger seat had a plastic bag on it that I guess was supposed to protect from stains from the mechanics, but there was still a palm-sized black grease smudge on the seat and a metal part sitting in my passenger seat. Who knows what that was from or if I still need it. There was also a bag with a Subway wrapper and an empty soda bottle, someone had lunch in my car.\n\nI didn't notice until i got home (it was Christmas Eve and I wanted to get out of there) but I had some weird charges on my bill:\n$225 work requested machine work - what is that?\noil filter and oil, although I was told I needed to bring it back for an oil change\n$54.58 \"discount\" on what and for what, I have no idea\nThe day I sat in the lobby for five hours I was told I needed another $200 part, but it would be free because of the hassle. It's not listed on my bill at all, not even to indicate the discount.\nAlso, I bought a Yelp deal which theoretically should have lowered the cost, but it seems as though they just added an extra charge to balance it out.\n\nThe shop manager offered to give me a free oil change because I had to wait so long for my car. Which annoyed me because according to my bill I was already charged for an oil change.\n\nShortly after getting my car back it was struggling to start, the heater wasn't working, and when I slowed down or hit a bump, you can hear something rattling under my hood. I brought it back and was told the battery was dead. Also because I had posted pictures of my trashed front seat on Yelp, they offered to clean up my front seat and have my car detailed [they also called and messaged me about posting my pictures on Yelp, which is another reason why I hesitated to post this review]. Since they were charging me $100+ to replace a dead battery (that died because my car was sitting in their shop for more than 2 weeks) I just wanted to get away from there.\n\nAlmost a month later smoke was coming from under my hood and it was overheating. Had the car towed to their shop and was told the radiator hose was blown. That made me furious because they just replaced my radiator, wouldn't they have seen a faulty hose? I'm out another $100+.\n\nThen I'm told I should just get a new car because the next time I bring it to them they'll probably have to replace the engine. \n\nI wish I had taken their advice when my car first blew its gasket, instead I feel like I threw away $2,000; money I could have invested in a new car, which I did eventually end up buyi", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Came here for lunch because Miraki the Greek  kabob place was so busy.

I placed a delivery order on line with DoorDash at 6 pm and received a confirmation email saying delivery would be in 74 minutes. Someone from Sonata's called at 6:06 pm to say they no longer have the Napoleon dessert, and they were changing out request to chocolate cake. I said that was fine and hoped they would bring back the Napolean. At about 7 PM, I started to wonder how much longer our order would be. I had no calls or texts so checked email. An email from DoorDash had come at 6:09 pm saying the restaurant had canceled my order. I called Sonata's and was told that they have changed their menu and don't carry the same items that Door Dash lists. So, they just cancel orders. I found the person very dismissive and wondered why they hadn't told me this when they called about the dessert.

So later that afternoon we called V&H ourselves and had them walk us through a 5 minute programming process and all but 4 of the settings (out of 49) were off. V&H said the Paks do not just reset themselves so if they were programmed properly the first time then nothing should have changed that.

Her portion was very tiny and her meat tasted and looked like any old pot roast.. Nothing special. Nothing she had on her plate justified the $28 price tag. My Ribeye was ordered as medium but came out as rare. When the manager (I assume that was a manager as she never said) she asked me to cut into it to make sure it was correct. This time it was. She never apologized, kind of just walked away.

I do wish they'd put chairs instead of benches.  Slightly awkward if you're alone or want to really relax.\n- Gorgeous grounds\n- delicious desert counter in the evenings in the lobby!\n\nHowever,\n- We booked online through the Starwood website.  None of our requests (only 2) were sent to the hotel.  We're talking simple things like non-alergenic pillows and high floor.  We got in late, so I addressed it the next morning and was told whoever booked it must not have transferred the codes.  I showed her the notes on my printed confirmation and told her I don't care what internal issues are involved.  Bottom line, I didn't get anything I requested.  \n- Room had an adjoining door.  Luckily the first night, nobody was next door.  The 2nd night, I got to listen to the couple next door talking, watching TV, and then having sex.  At the sex point I finally called the front desk (after 11pm) and told them I need another room to sleep in and that I'm leaving my stuff here.  I just want to sleep and come back in the morning.  The sent me to a room in the middle of a hallway completely surrounded by other rooms, more than my first room.  I refused - finally got a room at far end of hallway and slept soundly.  Next morning when trying to charge breakfast and other items, staff kept saying we checked out.  Had to explain over and over that we're not checked out.  Anyway, it wasn't the couple's fault next door - the walls are just paper thin.\n- Tried to book a cabana at adult pool in advance, but was told they only do full day cabana rentals.  Bummer.  Didn't reserve one since I knew I wouldn't be to pool until 2pm.  Got to pool and probably only 4 out of about 15 cabanas appeared to be booked.  Apparently, they'd rather leave money on the table instead of doing half day rentals of cabanas.  Oh well.  They could have made more that day.  Spoke to pool manager later (just by chance) and he said, oh, see me next time.  I can arrange it for you.  OK, well I called the number on the website for cabana rentals.  Apparently, that's not the route to take.  The spa doesn't have the authority to do 1/2 day.  DON'T make me jump through hoops to figure out who to talk to.  I'm just trying to spend money!!!  The cabanas are not worth it anyway.  They're just patio tables under the tent.  Not like other hotels that have TV's, ceiling fans, etc.  These cabanas are old and outdated.\n- Pool service ended at 6, at which time children are allowed at the adult pool when their's closes.  At 6pm there was probably still 25 adults at the pool.  Such a shame, more money left on the table.  These people would continue to order food and drinks if they could.  Oh well.\n- Pool menu is very limited for drinks.  If you want white zinfandel, you're set.  There's only 3 wines and they won't go to another bar to get more options (I kept forgetting I'm not at the Four Seasons).  What you see is what you get and we're not going to do anything else.\n- 1 server for entire adult pool area.  This is Scottsdale and it's high season.  Seriously - get some help out here.\n- Green your room - this is one of those hotels where you're assaulted with fliers about reusing your towels, get extra SPG points for not having maid service, save water, save our world, etc.  How about no maid service, & give me $50 off my bill.  Why tell me to conserve water when you have green grass surrounding your entire resort, including alongside the pool, driveway, walkways, etc.  How about instead of telling me to conserve water, you conserve water and rip out some of your unnecessary grass in the DESERT!  If I'm paying your rates, I want a fresh towel!  Do you really need grass lining the 1/4 mile long driveway and around the pool that needs watered year around?  \n- I'm not cheap, but the room service breakfast prices are seriously out of control.  I think the cheap breakfast was $24.00 + $3.00 delivery + 22% gratuity.  Really?  22% we're charging now???  When will it cap out?

The front desk told us that availability was \"intermittent\" and they could do nothing about it.  The first night we got in extremely late and immediately found that the main lamp in our room did not work, phone did not work and in the morning, I discovered the hair dryer did not work (albeit in the middle of trying to style my hair).  After we reported these problems, they did fix them however did not feel any compensation was in order.  I will say that the bed/mattress was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in at any hotel.  Restaurants on the property were way overpriced and below average quality and service.  Gambling was OK but not happy about having to open yet another new player's card on a property that was formerly MGM.  There was also an inequity in the way they establish your player account - my husband's old MGM account was not on file so they gave him several comps for opening a new player account at Treasure Island but because my MGM account was still active in the system, they merely opened a new card for me there and told me I was ineligible for the comps.  Slots VERY tight.  Had a little luck at the tables but we will NEVER return to Treasure Island on future trips to Vegas.  I miss the old Treasure Island and the \"homey\" feel the place used to have.  The clientele is not what it used to be either.  Not upscale at all.

I don't want to fuss over their card points wtv thing. If I want to go with my family out of the blue somewhere, this experience just isn't worth 200$.\n\nMovies themselves aren't that impressive anymore, so it would make sense to make a theater more about the actual experience of a theater. \n\nMore comfortable plush chairs for the general seating, like guzzo, please!\nAlso tried the extra priced reserved seating once, said we could lean our seats back.

What a horrible business choice, are they fkn retarded?!\n\nI wouldn't mind paying DOUBLE or maybe even tripple the price for actual couch seats, which the price can compensate the theater since it would mean less seats inside, but that can be a great thing because it would mean it would be less crowded! Now that is a luxurious experience! Maybe even add tables! I know that's a crazy idea, but hey, we don't have huge screens like this at home, and there is no sound system as awesome as ones in a theater, no matter how much we pay. It will never feel as epic as a theater. Nice idea for a treat above regular movie experiences once in a while.\n\nWhy not reserve 1-2 theater rooms for special seats that move like they have in theater parks? Can rotate the films, and just handle the way the seats move and vibrate. (of course include 3d glasses, but have the film in actual...

I'm sure people would be ok to pay more for such tickets, but not as much as a regular movie ticket because it's not as long, and they'd want to come back each week, since they're hooked. Honestly I feel that would help us stop binge watching so much. This can be a fun idea for people who want to rewatch the entire show as they wait a few months for a new season to begin, but I don't know how they'd organize this into the schedule. But honestly, there are some shows that would look great on a large screen because of the artistry/themes, like Vikings, etc. Fk it just take the most popular shows, and do like they did in the old days, and let us use your screens lol I wouldn't mind spending 30 min in the theater watching Rick & Morty.

I was shown the apartment in a reasonable time period, got a cosigner just fine, and they explained all of the processes for renting with them. Requests for maintenance were immediately resolved and I was not hounded for rent or any other payments if I forgot. The property itself was well kept with regular upkeep and more mature, quiet neighbors. These buildings are older (60s-70s) but they had huge bedrooms and ample closet space for a 1 bedroom. The building also supplied a parking space, laundry room shared with another building, and was super  close to stores and UofI campus. \n\nMy only complaint about this group is the difficulty with subleasing. I understand that they would prefer folks to stay but Champaign is a transient town. Making it hard for folks to find a sublessee does not create a happy partnership. In their defense they do allow you to sublet at all. You have to find your own person, pay a fee for the application (I think it was $60 or so), and they (the sublessee) also have to give a deposit for the apartment (one month's rent). I think this was unreasonable (basically they get to keep double the rent, mine and the new person, and I'm not even staying there anymore) and they do not disperse this money to more than one person. Meaning if you find a stranger to sublease, you have to work out a legal contract with them about who the deposit is returned to as opposed to PPM just giving the money back to who gave it to them.

Unfortunately we had some really loud neighbors the first night on both sides, loud electronics music at 5 am, and what sounded like a party going on. Also, lots of party goers coming in at all hours of the night and yelling down the hallway.  Have some respect people!

It was rich and not the nutritious healthy breakfast you may be used to but quite tasty. My husband ordered their burger which was decent. Our other friends ordered the Chicken and Waffles which was pretty tasty and the Smoked Salmon Scramble which was probably the healthiest item in their menu.\n\nOne thing I did not appreciate about this place is how strict they were with changes or substitutions. One girl wanted to change a croissant for a toast and they said they don't have toast. And my husband wanted to have a bun less burger and wanted his fries replaced with salad. They said he had to removes the burger himself once he gets it because they can make it bun less in the kitchen. And they also said he had to order the salad separately. Even though my meal came with a side salad so not quite sure why they couldn't just give him a salad instead of fries.

When we asked if they could make plain noodles we were told no by manager/owner, then they changed their mind and took chicken out but still charged $9.00. They would NOT adjust the price for removing the meat, nor would they make a smaller portion.....NOT nice!!!! poor waiter was mortified at the stinginess of his \"boss\". \n2. The entrees are substantial and beg to be left overs. They are initially served with about 3/4 c. of rice (not enough for the size of entree) when I requested more rice to take with left overs, she charged me $1.00 for an even smaller portion to take home!!!  These were already $9.00 dishes! \nMy point is.....why couldn't she just be nice and give me the the damn rice? and Smile for crying out loud.\nI will not be going back!!!!!!

I have never seen a better job of adaptive reuse in a theatre. This spot has held a failed restaurant, a failed dinner theatre, and probably a few others I don't know about. Webbs really deserves to succeed!\n\nWe were there for a weekday lunch, and there was a respectable group downstairs. The iced tea was good but surprisingly priced at $2.95. Now, before you react strongly, know that it came in a real glass and not one of those plastic tumblers, it came with a large and just-cut wedge of lemon, and when the volume dropped below half, our server brought me another full glass with another lemon wedge.\n\nWe sampled three appetizers. Here are our thoughts in order of success. The chef's daily soup was black bean and tortilla. The first bowl was rejected because it was just barely lukewarm; this is a big complaint -- don't serve soup unless you *know* it's hot. And the replacement took a long time; the other two appetizers had been eaten before it arrived. Sadly, the taste was not worth all this. It reminded me of Amy's, which is a very good canned soup, but I was expecting a deeper flavor and better viscosity. The next item was better. The \"Cheesy Bread\" was a slice of baguette-style bread covered with a thick cheese topping. The cheese flavor was full and satisfying, though the overall effect was too heavily salted. Last was the clear winner and what Webb's is known for -- the Duck Cigars. I recommend that you get these at every visit. They are good by themselves, and they come with three dipping sauces. The filling is made from ground duck confit and vegetables and is wrapped in a delicate spring roll style wrapper and then fried: Great taste, multiple textures, dipping sauces, and fun to eat.\n\nNext, we tasted the Crab Mac & Cheese. This was even better than the Duck Cigars. There was plenty of crab, generous butter and cheese sauce for the macaroni, and it came hot and golden brown. If you like mac and cheese and crab, then this is beyond satisfying. Also, it comes in a cute little cast iron dish. As a side dish, we tried the baked beans. This did not work out so well. The beans were well under-done, not even to \"al dente.\" The vinegar and the sugar were not well combined, so the sauce presented different tastes depending on where you tried. Our server mentioned that others during lunch had made this comment, so it would seem that this was not the normal product.\n\nThe kitchen is open, and I observed professional behavior throughout. The cooks are seriously trying to prepare and serve high quality food in a spotless kitchen. The menu is quirky and therefore interesting to me. You will not be bored! The interior is clean and beautifully restored and decorated with more to come, I'm told. Parking is not easy, but they offer valet in the evening.

Good selection.  You can buy all sorts of loose products: cereals, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, etc. from canisters.  You open the lever of the canister and pour as much as you want into a plastic bag.

In my teens I worked in a grocery store and struggled to maintain a friendly disposition, mainly out of being bored to death working at the register.

Unless you take home six figures per year and just parked your brand new Jaguar in the parking lot, don't even walk through the front doors.  Seriously, this place is expensive.  I am a New Jersey native where EVERYTHING is expensive and I thought Whole Foods was highly priced (just to give you an idea).  My husband and I spent like $45.00 on 2 plastic grocery bags of food - and we didn't buy any meats or items that are usually highly prices anyway.  Something to keep in mind.

I love my pho with extra lime, and if more garnishes are needed, you can always ask for more! You might have to ask more than once though because they can be quite forgetful.

I don't know if he recognized us as returning customers or this is his policy but that level of Manager awareness and remedy is very commendable.\n\nCircling back to the scene, there is a solidly fun vibe to this beach house-style decor.  The DJ seems to never stop and plays a great spread of tracks. The upper deck couches are fun and comfortable and the table booths are equally set up to enjoy dinner while still being inside the buzz.  I would kick this whole review up a star if the house would grasp the concept that even Friday's understands...as the crowd grows, the music should NOT.  At risk of echoing the comments of other reviewers and sounding twenty years older, the scene is best early, ahead of the place reaching 50% capacity.   Look, we all like to feel the thump of base in our chests and rhythm in our feet but not at the expense of yelling at the persons we came with standing the length of a soda straw away.  I could get the same effect and a lower bar bill by just hanging at the bar, putting my friends on FaceTime then asking them to hit mute on their end.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE:  Service is organizationally novice but the staff is incredibly upbeat and friendly, clearly trying with great intent.  Super friendly, just unskilled.  Plus, there are a number of menu misses.  Every version of their French fries are unimpressive.  Not bad per say, just unimaginative.  Buffalo-style anything is a nod to drunk frat boys blowing their money for the night on over priced drinks but realizing they gotta eat.  And putting that same Franks Red Hot sauce on potato chips is equally a miss.  The Mac-and-Cheese falls short of getting any attention.  In fact I had to rebook at the bill to even remember we ordered it.\n\nTHE BAD:  I have already crossed the noise level discussion.  The drinks are weak and even for Old Town, priced too high.  If you are going to charge $15 for Hendrick's , St. Germaine and soda then make it in a clean glass, make it constantly each time I order it consecutively and actually use Hendrick's.  These bartenders are routinely scrambling and I imagine they are getting very lucky that most guests are ordering drinks they only have to cork and pour, not mix.  I would only add, get rid of the bathroom attendant. It a relic concept that is simply creepy weird.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Girls weekend in Vegas was a success !

These wings are baked and they use some sort of buffalo type rub instead of the drippy sauce. The rub was flavorful and had a bit of a kick, but not overly so. The four of us shared the California pizza and the Meaty Meaty. The California was a neopolitan style of pizza and had mozzarella, blue cheese, tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon and spinach on top. it was awesome. The Meaty meaty had sausage, pepperoni, canadian bacon on the classic Picazzo's crust. The crust was very nice but the pizza itself was greasy and not overly memorable. All four of us agreed that the California was a homerun for sure. We also shared a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie skillet dessert. The desserts were tasty and just the right temperature.

I had the veggie burger since I'm vegetarian, which had an awesome description but was pretty effing bland. It was made of mushrooms, brown and white rice, lentils, caramelized onions, peas, and potatoes. It tasted just faintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. I had mine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda too soft. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing special. Same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic burger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. I was SUPER excited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were pickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy. \n\nI don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the toppings.

Like another reviewer said, quality beats quantity for me, and quantity is the main strength of this store.\n\nSome of the employees are unfriendly, mutter at you, and seem uninterested in customer service. If you aren't sure where something is, they kind of groan at you and give a crappy description of where to find it. For the most part, at least. Keep in mind this isn't all of the employees -- some of the employees are perfectly fine and friendly.\n\nAgain, the advantage if quantity over quality -- they are more likely to have something random you're looking for, but their shelves also contain lots of crap in the music/tv/movies section. The organization is generally okay -- it's usually in alphabetical order...usually -- so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding something.\n\nThe weakest section is the music section. There are lots of CD's....but who really buys CDs anymore? The only physical music I buy anymore is vinyl, and their selection isn't great. they have some random new releases, and some old classics....and more Teddy Pendergrass than anyone ever needs. \n\nThe section I spend the most time in is the basement with the comics and toys. I will admit, the inventory of comics is great. They have a ton of comics here, best in the area as far as I can tell. The prices, aren't great. All of the back issues were marked up at least 50 cents more than I find other places. I'm not one to complain about 50 cents, it just discourages me from buying more from them. This is why I only go there for stuff that I haven't found elsewhere. \n\nThe toys are more of a great nostalgic trip than anything I'm exactly interested in buying. They contribute to the ambiance, but I can't see myself actually buying any. Although, there was a toy DragonZord there, and once I have a home office, you better bet I will go back and buy that to decorate the new office with it!\n\nSo if you just want to browse media, it's a fun place to go.

No complaints with any of that equipment. The busy lobby always had a nice scent (random I know) and soothing piano playing and water features. Keycard elevator access gave us peace of mind. The mini convenience store on site was actually fairly priced (for Vegas) and the staff super friendly. Business center had free printing and in room wireless internet was available for $13.95 for 3 nights which I found reasonable (should be free!) Check-out took less than 1 minute and the tucked away location on the Strip can't be beat, never had problems grabbing a cab or walking to any of the nearby properties.

Since the closure of The Eddy, there has been a void of a purely blues venue in Calgary.  The Blues Can claims to fill the void, but only partially delivers.\n\nThe Blues Can makes some of the same old mistakes that countless lame Calgary bars / wanna be music venues make.  Overcharging for drinks after happy hour is one. Juuuuust bloody well have at least one thing every night thats $3.50 or $4.00. Maybe become famous for $4 cans of Canadian all the time or something.\n\n Also, an exorbitant cover charge gets boring. Charge $5 and book local acts who dont demand  high guarantees but sound the same or better as the \"well known\" stuff, which is often generic crap anyway (Bill Dowey for example). Then..... once in a while charge $12 or $15 for someone whos ACTUALLY well known? DO you know what you could have charged for tickets if YOU had Johnny WInter when he came thru town last month?? A fortune if you had your act together man! :)  \n\nOn one of my visits to the Blues Can, I nearly cried because there were no blues at all! Instead some kind of semi-basement-wannaa-be-pro \"HEavy Metal Jam Night\". Hahahah! There was no one there except the members of the \"bands\" LOL. Do some research, and you will find that pretty much every jam night thing in town is a fail, including this one :)\n\nThere ARE good things about The BLues Can though. The chef / cook is AWESOME and scratch makes some wicked grub. The menu is overpriced, especially for a blues bar. When the hell did a blues bar become a cartoon mockery of itself catering to suit and tie people instead of the depressed working class !!??\n\nSO to summarise, I am on the fence about The Blues Can.

They had the usual stir-fried items you'd find at a Chinese buffet, a cold seafood bar, a section of deep fried things, soups, and desserts.

Finally, I planned in advance and went on August 22. It was fun and delicious - I would go back - but not as top-notch as it should be for the hype and the price. Also, there are a few things I didn't like about the experience, explained below.\n\nThe meal is served in a small dining area back and to the right of the bar. Eight people sit around a small kitchen, where some prep-work is done. I didn't like how dark it was - clearly this was done for mood, but it went beyond the typical mood lighting and was made it difficult to see everything that was going on. I am also not sure how I felt about the seating arrangement. It made dinner conversation a bit awkward (you pretty much don't feel comfortable talking about much other than the food in front of strangers). It was fun to be able to see some of the prep, but the truth is that most of what was done in front of us amounted to plating, pouring sauces, squeezing filling into tubes, etc. I have been to other molecular gastronomy restaurants that do much more theatrical table-side \"shows\" than this restaurant did in a kitchen set up for it, so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe food was the definite highlight! There were many stand-out courses (like the salt-crusted foie gras, although the portion was tiny compared to the huge mass they brought out to show us before taking it back to the kitchen to cut!). They gave us a lot of really interesting combinations, like chocolate and olive oil, and other savory/sweet combinations - even when the combinations didn't quite work, they were really interesting (but most of them really worked!)\n\nA tip on the beverage pairing: get the lower-end one. I usually do just because I don't think I'm refined enough for it to make a huge difference! However in this case, I was really happy I did. One of the champagnes was served in something similar to a turkish coffee pot - the ones you lift way up high as you pour. We were instructed to do the same as we poured into our mouths. One person at our table ordered the high end pairing, and they served his in a regular champagne glass!\n\nOne final complaint: This is nitpicky, but when they brought the bill they made a point of telling us that service was already included (20%), but that we are always allowed to leave more, and it is always appreciated. I always think it is so tacky when they do that! The service actually was really friendly, but that turned me off. (I will note that the service was a bit too formal for my taste, especially when you are already sitting around a kitchen. They plated the dishes and then waited for more waiters to come so that they could serve everything at the exact same time. It seemed to be the opposite of the vibe they were going for.)\n\nI would give the food four stars (delicious, but definitely not as good as other restaurants in the same price bracket, like Alinea), but the overall experience three stars.

However, the chestnut layer was a bit dry and crusty. Most likely because it had been left out for quite some time. \n\nTarte Tiramisu ($7.75) - They use the same tart base as the Mont Blanc except there is chocolate cake inside the tart. It was not bad but would have liked the coffee liquor flavour to be more pronounced. \n\nChoux a la Creme ($4.75) - The texture of the cream was nice but matcha flavour was not too prominent. Others may find this to be bland with a hint of matcha bitterness from the after taste. \n\nFor the price of the tarts, I expected a higher level of quality. If they are trying to emulate Duo Patisserie (which is at the same price level) then they have a long ways to go as their pastries are not near their level. Also it would be nice if they had a short description written below each item on their tags rather than just the name and price.

Good enough, and for just $4.95, almost a meal in itself.  The chorizo was fine, but nothing spectacular.  I tried the skirt steak, again a huge portion for $19.95.  Two people with reasonable appetites could share the spinach pie and skirt steak and be perfectly satisfied.  The quality of the beef was very good, but the steak tasted too much like the gas flame it was grilled over.  Obviously, no wood grill at Rincon.  Also, I ordered the steak medium-rare, but it came out closer to medium, a mistake a lot of steakhouses make.  The steak came with a choice of potato, soup, salad, or mixed vegetables.  The mixed vegetables looked like the once-frozen variety, but at least good quality frozen veggies.  I got the huge portion of veggies wrapped because I wanted to try a couple of their desserts.  The Argentine alfajor was two thin cookies with a caramel paste in the middle, then dipped in white chocolate, good enough but not great.  The mil hojas (the Argentine version of a mille feuille) was what I really wanted to try.  Instead of pastry cream, the Argentine version fills the pastry layers with a caramel paste.

The prices and quality of their meats make for an excellent value.  And I loved the authenticity of the place.  Even if their execution isn't always top-notch, I had no doubt that this was true Argentine cuisine.

At Swish, you're seated at a long, u-shaped counter with a hot pot placed in front of each diner. Unfortunately, the pot is placed in an awkward location, forcing the diner to reach up over the bar, and then at a downward angle, to swish their food.

I definitely prefer the more intimate, table setting found at other shabu-shabu places around town.\n\nThe food: The selection of veggies served with the shabu-shabu/sukiyaki dishes were lackluster.

I still wanted to give them a try since the restaurant is so close to Galleria (Korean market) that I go to every weekend.\n\nI dropped by for lunch on a Saturday and found the restaurant to be quite empty.

I like how they maintain the salsa bar and keep it well-stocked. Usually I don't go for the spicy carrots, it's cut way too thick. I'll choose the cucumbers and the mild green sauce, but if you like your food extra spicy then go for the red sauce. \n\nI ordered the #13 Chicken Chimichanga which is serve with Spanish rice, pico de gallo, and refried beans, added a side of french fries, and a horchata. The Chimichanga is a fried burrito topped with a lot of sour cream and very little guacamole. It's mostly filled with shredded chicken. There's small pieces of saut\u00e9ed bell pepper and onions, but the chicken is still lacking flavor. It would taste better if they include Spanish rice inside the Chimichanga just to balance the large serving of meat. \n\nNow the french fries are small, but it's serve hot and crispy.

I can't figure out the reasoning for that! There were maybe 2 small bites left and when my boyfriend indicated verbally and nonverbally that he was done, the waiter insisted he needed more toast points for his tartar.

Sure, the buffet tables were long, but the food was mediocre in that I was strictly looking for meat dishes and ignoring the carbs.  That meant my several slices of prime rib went down nicely with the glass of water (no soda, the bubbles make you puff up) and I was equally charmed by the BBQ beef ribs (went back for 6 ribs) because they were juicy and blubbery.  Some of the chicken (Piccata style) was slightly dry but the somewhat watery crab legs and shrimp covered up the lag.

Sandwiches come with a small side of tomato soup, and though I have only been there twice, each time the soup tasted a bit different, as though they haven't quite landed on the recipe yet.

This, I suppose, is a good time to point out the really not so good, which is the bread situation.  Now, they use really nice, thick bread, which is a good start.  Where these grilled cheese sandwiches are missing the mark is the truly *grilled* part.  The bread comes out so dry that I suspect that it's actually toasted, not grilled.  I guess that's  good if you're watching calories and don't want your bread grilled in butter until it caramelizes the sugars in the bread and achieves that nice golden brown crust.  But friends, if I'm already ordering a sandwich with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg, I can tell you that I most assuredly am NOT coming here looking to cut calories.  Please grill the bread.

So good, in fact, that our waiter informed us they were out and it would be 30 minutes before a fresh batch was battered.  Deterred, so settled on the wild salmon as a backup and I placed my order for the bistro steak.  A few minutes later, we decided that waiting 30 minutes for the fried chicken wasn't so bad and we flagged down the owner to have the order changed.  Unfortunately, he did not pass the message to our waiter or the kitchen.  This was confirmed when out waiter came around.  He then proceeded to inform us it would be far more than 30 minutes, since they have to, inexplicably, close the whole kitchen down to fry the chicken.

The owner later indicated he was going to buy a 2nd fryer the following week.\n\nSo, back to plan B.  Anyway, our orders arrived and they were underwhelming.

Even without a reservation, my party of 3 was seated within 5 minutes, maybe we got lucky. Anyway, the vibe is a weird mix of your modern restaurant with a bar/club feel. There was a birthday party on the rooftop, and you could hear the music pumping through the walls. A little bit distracting for some people, but it was okay for me.\n\n4/5 - Food\n3/5 - Overall Experience\n\nThe food is on the pricier side, considering this is not a a strict restaurant per se, as some of the appetizers ran near $20. At those prices for an appetizer you start entering the same price range as a true fine dining restaurant. My group had some butternut squash shrimp ravioli to share, which was 3 pieces for $16. I tried the bacon cheese burger, and the other two entrees were the Jambalaya bowl, and some short rib pasta.\n\nThe burger was good, though nothing spectacular for a $18 burger, considering the cheese was your processed orange American cheese. The short rib pasta had healthy chunks of braised rib, though they erred on the pastier drier side. The Jambalaya bowl was good, with well seasoned sauce and fragrant rice. The ravioli was very delicious, but considering the filling was squash, and with only one shrimp per ravioli, the price is steep. The cocktails are good, and served creatively. I enjoyed a Moscow Mule in a copper mug. They also had steaks, but I would prefer to support local steakhouses for a similar price.\n\nConsidering this place deems itself per their website \"a casual fine dining experience\", I'd say it was much more on the casual side. We were seated at a table before it was set and ready. There was sticky sauce residue on the table, and I had to ask my server to wipe it down for me. There were no introductions or any communication really from the server, she just came to refill water, take drink and food orders, and that was it.\n\nOverall, this restaurant chain is a upscale, 'fancier' Milestones, with the prices to match.

Over 300 dishes are found on the menu, ranging from the classic Hong Kong style baked pork chop rice to the Americanized sweet and sour pork. Even Hawaiian roast pork appears on the menu. Despite offering a wide selection of Chinese dishes, Asian Cafe Express lacks the \"outstanding factor\" since it is a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" restaurant. This type of restaurant serves nearly everything in an ordinary fashion and neglects to specialize in any particular dish.\n\nI came to Asian Cafe Express for a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed. Most of the guests were eating ACE's $3.98 special bowl, a one-item Americanized rice bowl (kung pao chicken, teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc.). I summoned the Cantonese waiter and ordered a baked pork chop rice. He told me I would have to wait 45 minutes to 1 hour for this dish. LOL, who has that long to eat lunch? In nearly all HK cafes that I have been to, only 10 to 15 minutes is required to deliver this dish to my table even when the kitchen is busy. All the ingredients are generally pre-processed such that the rice just needs to be stir-fried and the ingredients just needs to be baked to melt the cheese before the baked pork chop rice is served. Unfortunately, this preparation is absent at ACE, likely due to its low demand. A 60 minute estimate suggests that the pork chops had not been cut and fried, the vegetables have not been diced, and/or the rice has not been stir-fried or cooked. Basically the dish is cooked from scratch. \n\nAlternatively, I ordered the Fresh Tomatoes with Two Eggs and Beef since it was guaranteed to be out instantly. It arrived in 20 minutes. This rice plate is considered as a basic and classic HK over-rice dish. It was acceptable, the egg was fried crispy on the corners yet not burnt, an attribute that even some HK cafes in Southern California neglect. The tomatoes gravy was not as salty as I expected and beef were tender and cooked properly. However, my biggest concern was the rice that was used. The rice texture was poor. It resembled a very loose rice pilaf rather than Jasmine rice. Rice pilaf is highly uncharacteristic of what is served at a traditional Hong Kong style cafe.\n\nTo complement the rice dish, I also ordered the daily soup - a carrot and Chinese vegetable soup. It was probably the best Cantonese old-fire soup available in Arizona. Unfortunately, the soup was very oily and contained a lot of MSG. It definitely does not pass the home-style quality test.\n\nFinally, I ordered the HK style coffee with milk tea (yin-yeung), to complete the HK-cafe experience. The young waiter informed me that it would take over 30 minutes to prepare, because he had to boil the water and then steep the tea. I received the drink in a soup cup (LOL). I could tell that milk tea and hot beverages are not ordered often enough for the restaurant to order mugs. The yin yeung was prepared with the HK-style procedure, mixing coffee and milk tea in equal proportions, but the milk tea was prepared in an odd way (red tea was mixed with a dash of 2% milk). Overall, the taste was acceptable for Arizona standards. At least better than some places in LA, which give you 75% coffee, 25% English tea, and condensed milk. \n\nAsian Cafe Express offers authentic Cantonese dishes on their menu but I think some of the proper ingredients are lacking in Arizona, so the dishes cannot be prepared with the same standard as those found in Hong Kong or even Los Angeles.

In theory, the crab legs were available at 4 for us to go up and get some.  In reality, however, the crab leg line turned into a full on pit fight right at 4pm.  We were there a couple of days before Mayweather-Pacquiao, but I guess the other buffet patrons didn't want to spring for Pay-Per-View and decided to have their own boxing match when the crab arrived.  People were pushing and shoving, cutting line for crab legs.  We decided to sip our drinks and wait for the carnage to clear,and then went up after about half an hour to get some crab legs.  And I will say, the legs were delicious!  They were nice and fresh, and it was awesome to have them split down the middle.

Too many dance venues have limited the ability to sit in a booth or at a couch unless you have ordered a couple of overpriced bottles. This is brutal in my eyes as it sets the people on a pedestal who just want to buy there way into being \"elite\" (yet are typically the ones that are that much more out of touch with the actual club scene to begin with).

Dim lighting, edged with red Christmas lights and candles whispered young and trendy to me. At some point, a live DJ came in, spinning pseudo Latin hits (think: pitbull)- fun, I guess, but playing the same tracks over and over has got to make you wonder if putting a play list on shuffle would have done the same thing. \n\nService: 2.5/5 \nI got there first, and was seated at a table for 6+ (although there were tables for 2 and 4 further back in the restaurant, and I told the hostesses that there would only be two of us, with maybe a third joining later). When the server came by, I asked if I could, or should, move to a smaller table at the back, to which she looked shocked, and said it'd be really out of the way... \nSo, I relented and stayed at my giant table.\n\nIn the (literally) 4 [FOUR!] minutes it took for my friend to arrive, I was asked if I wanted a drink three separate times by 2 different people.\n\nFriend arrives- and before she even takes off her coat, the server comes to ask us if we wanted drinks.

(\"margaritas, please\").\n\nAfter we get out margaritas, and the after several (I think I counted three) stop bys by our server, we got the salsa tower and chips. Not even half way through our mini bucket of chips, we were repeatedly asked if we wanted to order food. Repeatedly. \nFriend and I wanted to try to tacos- so ordered one each, and a knife to split.

I don't think this alone would have affected my opinion... but it was awkward. \n\nOverall, the service wasn't BAD... it was strange: with the constant need to impress and hovering around our table, I wasn't sure if I should have felt bad for her or annoyed.\n\nFood: [Taste: 5/5; value 2/5]\nAh, the good stuff! \nThe food here is undoubtedly delicious.\n\nStarted with classic margarita (~$9). Served over crushed ice, they were poured strong, and the perfect combination of sweet, tart and boozy delicious.\n\nSalsa tower, served with mixed chips (~$4.25?), will likely be the only food I get if I come back here. Chips were made of plantains, taro and sweet potatoes, not too salty with a brilliant crunch. Amazing!\n\nFlank steak taco (~$4.50). So good, but so TINY. (Hence the aforementioned eyebrow raise). Seriously tiny. Think the circumference of a mini cupcake: tiny. maybe 1 oz of flank steak... That being said, it burst with flavour, the meat was lean and tender, and the soft shell held in all the piping hot juices.  \n\nMushroom taco (~$4.25). Amazing flavour, but again, same size as the flank steak: a one-biter. Softer and tender, with a really unique taco shell, I wish it were bigger!\n\nChurros (~$4.50): served three to a glass half filled with some sort of pastry cream, these little bites were great. Crispy and light cinnamon sugar danced on my tongue while the pastry cream thing brought some weight to the dessert. Oddly refreshing, had I known, I would have gotten my own instead of sharing!\n\nAll in all, delicious, but very very pricey. I'm glad I had nibbled at work before hand, otherwise I would have left El Cabillito broke, or starving. \n\nI think I'd come back to meet friends for a drink... but not for dinner.

Il faut une heure au restaurant pour faire un tour complet mais honn\u00eatement vous ferez \u00e0 coup sur un tour.\n\nLe concept de restaurant est sympa et en plus de cela il s'agit d'un buffet unique pour un prix relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de 60dollars par personnes (sans les taxes). Je pense que l'on paye un peu la vue mais pas uniquement. Le service est vraiment agr\u00e9able, r\u00e9actif et digne d'un grand restaurant (enfin presque). Cot\u00e9 nourriture comme il s'agit d'un buffet il et difficile de vous dire tout ce qui est disponible mais on y trouve en entr\u00e9 des salades, du homard, du saumon et d'autres produit divers et vari\u00e9s. La partie entr\u00e9e est la seule qui se trouve sur la partie tournante et qui est donc toujours  au m\u00eame endroit par rapport \u00e0 bous. Par contre du fait de la rotation du restaurant vous ne bougerez pas en m\u00eame temps que les plats et dessert et des fois c'est d\u00e9concertant de faire tout le tour pour trouver son plat et retrouver sa table. \n\nPour les plats il y a un large choix de plat chaud ou de pattes faites \u00e0 la commande avec pleins de recettes diff\u00e9rentes. Pour la qualit\u00e9 rien \u00e0 redire et tout est maintenu au chaud. Il en est de m\u00eame pour le fromage et les dessert puisque le buffet vous laisse une grande libert\u00e9 de choix et d'assortiment.\nC'est bien joli de parler de la nourriture dans un restaurant mais cela ne fait pas tout. Par exemple la d\u00e9coration est totalement horrible avec de la moquette par terre et des \" \u0153uvres \" d'art \u00e0 certains endroit qui laissent perplexe. Perso je trouve que pour un restaurant de ce style c'est un peu vieillot.

It had no seasoning or herbs and even the yogurt dipping sauce that came with it didn't help much. For being what seemed to be a special of the restaurant, it was quite disappointing. \n\nService/Ambiance - We came in on a Sunday early afternoon and the restaurant was pretty much empty - there was only a family having lunch so we were seated quite promptly. The service was below average to average. Basically it seemed like he just really didn't care. He did answer our questions about the menu but that was the extent of our interaction. No one came by to check how things were tasting and it was a bit slow at the end to pay. The restaurant is pretty bare bones. It's a pleasant atmosphere but nothing extraordinary. It is a good casual place to grab food. It is a decent size so probably good for groups.\n\nOverall, we were left full and relatively satisfied with our meals. From what I have heard, Damas would have been a much better option, albeit at a higher price point. I don't think I would come back here but it was not an unpleasant experience.

Everyone we came across that worked at the hotel were nice so overall, not a bad place.\n\nThe reason for a 3-star and not a 5? Well, the valet situation is kind of crazy, not to mention parking is an additional fee per night; most Vegas casinos have complimentary parking, not to mention, we are guests at the hotel. Upon getting into our room, I open the curtain to see what type of view we got and I get a brick wall (literally a brick wall), so zero view. We were on the 2nd floor, no risk in anyone jumping -plus the window/door doesn't open anyway. My other dislike is that above us was noise that sounded like furniture was being dragged from one side of the room to the other and it was only very early in the morning and very late at night. I did complain to my \"personal\" concierge and was told they'd check on it but it was constant; every. single. night. for the 3-nights we stayed. I complained about it twice and it just fell on deaf ears. There ya have it, I took off 2-stars off for the reasons I stated!\n\nWould I stay here again? YES!

Then I was moved to the infamous lake front floor 1 - where do I even start? Not only is everyone walking by outside on the path right by your room, but on the way from the elevator to the rooms there are doors leading straight into the car parking.

There is one metal door between the potentially hundreds (?) of cars and the guest rooms. I have no idea how that can be to code? I am just praying that there are at least carbon monoxide detectors, but what if they don't work? Just scary... Hygiene: there are robes in the rooms but the robes are hung in the toilet cubicles.

And how come your head housekeeper did not notice and fix this already? And the non-existing customer service skills...

Seriously, that is a quote. You couldn't make this up.... Even if these were muskrats and they are not as bad as other rats (I don't know) there are ways of communicating this to a customer in a respectful way and telling them to be a happy about the Wisconsin \"otters\" is not really one of them.

(Fresh has yet to disappoint, for example.)\n\nSo it was that I found myself sitting in Planta on a very snowy February weekend. I suppose I should first say that I was extremely unhappy with the service. Our waitress appeared fairly quickly when we first sat down, but then disappeared for a full 20 minutes after that. I was going to order the nachos as a starter but I was so annoyed that I decided to skip it.\n\nInstead, I ordered one of the specials. It was a pizza, and it's not listed anywhere on the internet (and I forgot to take a picture of the menu), so I can't tell you exactly what it was or what was on it.\n\nAnyway, it was fine. It was topped with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, cashew mozzarella, asparagus, and some kind of green sauce. The first few bites were actually surprisingly tasty; the caramelized onions were quite prominent, and the rest of the toppings worked pretty well. (The asparagus not so much, since it kept coming off the pizza whole.) But this is a fairly enormous pizza pie and I honestly just got sick of eating it after the first couple of slices. There was no real depth of flavor here, which meant that every bite was the same - which, of course, meant that eating this thing got to be a bit of a repetitious grind after a while.\n\nBut maybe I'm being too harsh. As a vegan pizza, it's probably above average. Maybe, though, there's a reason that pizza isn't generally a vegan option.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "The Consol Energy Center is a big beautiful building for the fan to see an event.  The amenities are great and the arena has just about anything you could want.  However, I feel the Consol Energy Center severely lacks  personality, affordability, and the continuity of staff that the former arena had.\n\nThe Consol Energy Center is a very very very different facility from the Mellon Arena, a building that preceded the Consol.  Many are most likely glad for this.  I am not and here's why.  I miss the ol' Arena and it had nothing to do with the building itself. What I miss most about going to hockey games (and I went to approx 35 a year) at the Mellon Arena was what it didn't have in its physical 'being', it made up for by having the warmest and friendliest people inside. These people helped  you to your seat, shook your hand as you walked in, knew your name,and were glad you were there.  These people were in the same places game in and game out and were readily available.  It was very comforting.  \n\nThe Consol Energy Center lacks character simply put.  The people are shifted around from spot to spot and those that are there now are only interested in selling you something.  The atmosphere is almost as if the hockey game is secondary.   It's become so commercial.  For the common fan that goes to one game a year and buys a ticket off of ticketmaster, the Consol Energy Center has to be the best thing in the world.  The vantage points are great.  The HD Jumbotron is huge and vivid and the sound system is fantastic.  I'd give it all up to be back across the street.  \n\nFor a guy like me who spends 15k on season tickets, I need a little bit more than going to a mall to watch a hockey game.  I'd like to have the same usher, the same ticket guy, and the same people who know who you are and are glad you're there.  I'd like to not feel like a number or just a wallet walking around.  I don't need a urinal sponsored by some Light beer and I don't want hassled to give money for a 50/50 drawing after I've spent $500 just to get into the place.  I'd rather see the out of town scoreboard throughout the game but they'd rather show me one of there 700 commercials on their various scoreboards instead. \n\nAnother deficiency  is the Consol's affordability or lack thereof.  The food is too expensive.  $9 for a personal pizza?  $8 for nachos? $5 soda?  I realize it's a sporting event but this is boarder line fleecing.  .  \n\nSure, it's new and well thought out.  Yes, the cup holders are nice and the 50 different kinds of bottled beer you can buy for $9 is great if you can afford that sort of thing.  \n\nIt's a great new building with all the 'buzzes and whistles' and it's like sitting at one big half-time commercial.  It's just not for me.  I can't get past all of the ads, the prices, and the cold, mall like atmosphere the place has.

I guess I'll start with what was good about this place - Josh, our server, was FANTASTIC. He honestly saved the night! My family and I arrived at 8pm, on a Tuesday night, and he was the only server on the floor with a 12 top plus 5 other tables (not including us!). Upon greeting us he immediately apologized for seeming frazzled and still wore a huge smile! The manager clearly cut the floor way too early and it appeared as if she didn't even care - about the diners or the server! She stood around lollygagging instead of asking the server if he needed help with anything. At that point if you don't care about your server you should at least care about the guests and not have them wait 15+ minutes to get something as simple as a glass of wine. The poor guy was slammed! Then out of nowhere she pops up awkwardly and says, \"It's coming I'm promise your food will be here\" and walks away with no chance for us to say or ask anything. Come 8:45 our food still hadn't arrived and Josh came up to us and apologized saying that the kitchen was disorganized and just let him know they were out of salmon... we settled and ordered the Alfredo with chicken for my cousin. Finally 5 min later the food came out and that saved the night as well - I would give that a 4/5. My mushroom ravioli was so tasty, my other cousin loved the Olivia's flatbread and my mom was drooling over her chicken parm minus the mash potatoes (she wanted those instead of pasta) which seemed to be instant ready made nastiness. Unfortunately it starts going down hill again from here... It's now 8:55 (we've only had our food for 5 min and we ordered 30+ min ago) and we ask our server for more bread and he responds, \"Um let me check if I can get you some because I think my kitchen is closing down.\" I'm aware that the restaurant was scheduled to close at 9 but our food took forever to come out and we were never given a last call! You could tell the server was frustrated but still wore a genuine smile through it all. When he brought out the bread it was 9 o'clock on the dot and of course my 11 year old cousin was wanting dessert like most kids. My mom politely asked and followed up with, \"I know your kitchen is closing but would you mind checking for us?\" When he came back his response was, \"Sorry my kitchen said they're too tired but I would be more than happy to get you tiramisu or cannolis because I can do those myself.\" Josh was literally jumping through hoops and bending over backwards for us! We told him we appreciated his kindness but not to worry about it but asked if he could take off the Caesar salad she ordered because she didn't like it (it was very bland as well as her Alfredo). At the very end while waiting for our check the manager came over and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't like your salad\" and our response was, \"Don't worry about it, the rest of the food was great.\" All she said was \"You're so sweet\" and awkwardly walked off again... this lady needs to go! No apologies for the fact the food took so long or that the kitchen closed without giving last call or the fact that everything was such a mess! In the end: \nServer, Josh - 10/10\nFood - 7/10\nManager - She should be fired\nKitchen - Needs more organization \nI'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt and saying it was an off night.

My wife and I saw the ads through-out the casino and we came back from Hong Kong two weeks before (could it be close to what we had?!).  \n\nSo here goes:\n\nIf you are familiar with Cantonese food and HK-style Cha Chaan Tangs (you will know if you are, there is no grey area) here are some things that jumped out at me and my wife (you can jump to your own conclusions).  \n\n- The curry fishballs were expensive, and there was nothing unique or different about them even with the added cost.  This is the same, exact recipe you can find in any Chinatown but the price here jumped out a bit.\n\n- There is a statue of Buddha in the back corner ...  with a stack of 1.00 bills in his palm?? Did he win a slot machine mega bucks pay-out or is he going out clubbing??.  Come on, why bring peaceful Buddha into this?  Can you at least take some of the money and give it to a charity?\n\n- If it matters the menu and Casino advertisements had traditional written Chinese, but the comment card at the end had simplified writing (usually HK-style cafes use 100% traditional but maybe they serve a lot of Mandarin speakers who use simplified).  Neither good nor bad, just noticeable.\n\n- The HK milk-tea was a little too expensive , for both hot and cold options.  Again, any normal Hong Kong cafe will charge maybe 3.00 (and the tea here is the exact same, for a higher price).\n\nNow tell me, people with HK cafe experience, doesn't it sound like they're ripping off the casino patrons because of the casino location and dressed up interior??  \n\nMy wife and I just had basic snacks, I think we didn't want to be disappointed with their larger menu items.\n\n\nNow, for those of you who don't eat this type of food a lot:  Have fun and enjoy this authentic Hong Kong flavor!!

That is the word that sums up my experience here at this supposedly five-star establishment.\n\nI have been a dedicated customer and fan of the Bellagio for many years. I have always thought they showed  class, service, and value that many hotels on the strip did not provide. However, my most recent stay disappointed me for many reasons - i will mention them as i  write a detailed review of my entire stay below:\n\nThe service:\nHighly disappointed - While many aspects of the staff and service of this hotel was great as usual, there were a number of events that stood out and really made my stay very unsatisfying:\n1) upon check-out, i wanted to store my luggage with the bell desk b/c my flight was not set to take off until 6pm. I did not have small bills to tip the bell boy and needed the bigger bills for the cab. I thought i could make it up by tipping them again when i picked up the luggage at the end of the day. The bell boy reiterated upon receiving my luggage that he would not be here later that day and that someone else will be serving me in an obvious tone that was implying i needed to tip him. He also stood there quietly, for several seconds waiting for me to tip him. I felt uncomfortable and awkward and was forced to use what little cash i had on hand for him. This should not be the mentality of an employee of a five-star hotel!\n2) Update: I emailed the establishment of this complaint and all i got was an apology letter and that's it. No further follow-up, no nothing. \n3) The room: it was nice. The room is fairly large and the furniture and what not was well-kept and modern. The bathroom is large with two sinks, a separate shower, and a separate tub. I found all the amenities i needed in my bathroom. There was also a robe, iron, and safe. \n\nIn all, Bellagio embodies the nature of today's Vegas: a high-class surface masking the old, crude, low-class mentality that has always existed.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Sunday breakfast before the game and it was a pleasant experience.

The decor is neutral, edging toward the utilitarian. Although weeds are growing outside the door, inside the restaurant was clean. Background music was playing, the strains typical of coffee-house alternative pop.\n\nThe waitress asked whether we preferred to be seated at the grill (see below) or at a table. We chose a table. The menu includes a range of appetizers, some of which are fusion, such as fried corn cakes, chadol tostadas, and kimchi fries. Sadly for me, the mandoo (dumplings) come as vegetable only, but vegetarians might appreciate the option.\n\nWe found the appetizer fusion a fun concept (it's supposed to be Yori Q's central theme), so we tried the chadol tostadas and kimchi fries. The chadol tosadas came as (2) tostadas (flat corn tortillas with a crunch) topped mainly with onions, shredded cabbage, and a trace amount of sliced meat (beef deckle, or ribeye cap). They tasted good, but did not wow us. The kimchi fries were underwhelming. The waffle fries, though plentiful and perfect for sharing, were almost certainly from a freezer (not prepared fresh on site). They were not seasoned -- not a grain of salt as far as we could tell. They had two mayo-based sauces squeeze-bottled onto them. The kimchi covered only the very top of the pile of fries and even with a very small amount of freshly fried bacon cubes sprinkled over lacked in flavor. The small waffle fry mountain was topped with a generous portion of finely shredded spring onions.\n\nOf course, we also received banchan (side dishes), which are served before the meal in Korean bbq joints and often consist of housemade pickled things. In this case the banchan were kimchi, a sweet and sour cucumber and onion salad, cream-based coleslaw, cream-based macaroni salad with thinly sliced apples and celery, and sliced fish cake. We found the banchan underwhelming, too. They did not taste especially housemade, except for the cucumber and onion salad (just a hint more chili flavor than the standard Midwestern version). The kimchi was too mild. The coleslaw was not nearly as good as my mother's or mine. It lacked acid and black pepper. The macaroni salad was extremely bland, the whitest of white food. The sliced fish cake was almost certainly commercial.\n\nYori-Q offers a good range of entree styles, from hot plates to rice bowls, hot soups to cold noodles -- even three fusion burgers (bulgogi [beef], donkatsu [pork], and chicken). My partner and I chose the dolsat bibimbap with bulgogi added (my perennial favorite) and our son had the bulgogi rice bowl. \n\nI enjoyed the dolsat bibimbap, which is a traditional (non-fusion) Korean dish of mixed vegetables (steamed) over rice with a fried egg on top, served in a stone bowl (dolsat) heated so that the rice cooks in oil spread on the bottom until it becomes crisp and flavorful. Yori Q used a plain vegetable oil rather than sesame oil as the base, which is too bad (a missed opportunity to produce authentic flavor). The vegetables in bibimbap can vary slightly. Here, they were shredded carrots and daikon, bracken fern, kimchi, mushrooms, and zucchini. I don't particularly care for bracken fern (which basically tastes like slightly saline, soft-cooked stems), but it is authentic. The other vegetables were delicious. The egg was perfectly cooked, too, still soft enough for tender texture and sweet flavor (my partner said it was the highlight of the dish). The bulgogi was also tasty and tender, but served in a very small portion (two small bites, tops). A commercial gochujang is served in a squeeze bottle on the side (traditional) -- this is a red chili paste that has a low-medium heat profile and the texture of ketchup. Also served on the side is a small dish of beef broth with scallions to pour over and moisten the dish (the first time anywhere I've received this with bibimbap -- I don't know that it added much to the overall experience, but it was fun to try something new with an old favorite). Our son's bulgogi rice bowl was similar to the dolsat bibimbap, only it included less vegetables (by his design). It did not include much more meat in the portion, which disappointed him. He loved the flavor of the bulgogi. He did not find the rice had much flavor; it made up the majority of the dish.\n\nWould we go back? I love Korean food; my husband and son can take it or leave it. I'll probably go elsewhere for my fix, given other options in town. Some other Yelpers have mentioned that Yori Q has high prices, but $13 is about average for dolsat bibimbap and $7 isn't that bad for an appetizer at a nice restaurant. There are more expensive options on the menu, such as the $23 per person grill experience, but that is \"all you can eat,\" which seems reasonably priced.

Both were equivalent to no spice. They gave us the spicy sauce on the side since it seemed like they just forgot to add it. The sauce was really good and added a nice taste. It's not super spicy though if that is your heart's desire. \nThe lamb was tasty. the spicy taiwanese hot pot... maybe say no pork intestines (I'm totally not into it T-T). They ran out of rice and instant noodle for the taiwanese pot, but they didn't even tell us as we waited patiently for it. After the fact we asked for it and they said it was sold out. They just threw vermicelli in place of the instant noodle. They have one dipping sauce only, but THAT is actually damn good. In addition to using it as a dipping sauce, i threw some in my soup to add some flavor. My boyfriend and I were actually unable to finish our bowls. It is pretty filling. We definitely will SHARE a bowl next time so that we don't stuff ourselves from attempting to finish. \n\nI honestly could maybe give this place a higher rating (4) but the service was terrible. They are new, so I can give them a few passes, but they are three weeks in. Many things could be solved with basic communication. If items are sold out, they should communicate it to the staff instead of having the one server run back and forth. The owner does not really speak English which is totally fine, but they definitely need someone who can help communicate between customers and the staff and inter-staff as well. They are also extremely slow at sending out orders.

From the outside, the salon is in a tiny worn down shopping complex that could easily be missed. I was apprehensive. When I walked in the door though, I was pleasantly surprised! The salon is adorable, well decorated, and clean! \n\nI always scope out a new salon with a pedicure only before diving into my nails. I was pleasantly greeted from the moment I walked in the door, and was told to pick out a color. I have to say, I was really surprised at the small selection of polishes... the smallest I've ever seen in a salon. I kept looking around for more, but that was it. So, that was a bit discouraging.\n\nI get a color, sit down, and was made comfortable. A man who I'm assuming is the owner came over to see if we wanted anything to drink. I was offered water or wine, and my daughter who was also getting a pedicure was offered a Capri sun juice, which she loved! We were made to feel right at home. And, they have plastic disposable liners for their foot tubs... this is a HUUUUGE plus for me! It shows that the salon cares about cleanliness and nail health. I honestly don't know why more salons don't do this. \n\nAs I sat there, I noticed that the salon does have a large selection of gel polishes, so that was a plus! I really enjoyed my pedicure for the most part. My technician was a little too rough on my cuticles and nail beds, but she was very thorough. I just got the basic pedicure, which included a salt scrub and a steam towel. No massage, but still really nice for the cost.\n\nWhen it came time to paint my nails, I was disappointed to notice that the polish was very thick and goopy. I wasn't too surprised though, after seeing the small selection. As a result, it went on thick and uneven, and took forever to dry. It also did not dry smoothly, and looks gloppy and thick on my toes, and even bubbled in a few places. \n\nThat and the poor selection of polishes is my reason for the three stars. The customer service and salon alone though would get five stars. The customer service was seriously AMAZING. Everyone was so nice. And, my daughter loved it, and she's almost pickier than me! For those reasons, I will be back to give it another shot. I do hope they improve their polish selection. I understand that gels are very popular, but there are still quite a few people who just want polish; particularly for pedicures. My daughter can not get gels, and I personally do not want or need them on my toenails. \n\nHoping to update with a higher rating soon...

The sandwiches, or sliders to be correct, are in all honestly not that good. Unique? Absolutely. They have a flavor all their own. Simple? Uh huh. A basic square beef patty with 5 holes, grilled onions, cheese, a pickle and a steamed bun. No frills here. And you had better be sure you like that simplicity because if you order a combo meal, you will get at least 4 of these sliders. They're small. About 4 bites per sandwich small.  And they all come in their own tiny card board box. As do the fries. It seems like a lot of waste to me but I suppose it is tradition.\n\nThe sliders are recognizeable, by taste, as nothing other than being from White Castle. That isn't necessarily a good thing. The beef just doesn't taste that good. It tastes old or cheap. The onions are good as is the one pickle chip. None of it makes a crave worthy slider. They're greasy and funky. It is something you eat for the experience and the history. To me, its a one and done sort of visit. I waited a long time to try White Castle and now having tried it once, the novely is ended.\n\nThe fries are forgettable. Standard crinkle cut similar to those from Del Taco. They aren't bad fries just not exciting, unique, or all around stand-outs. White Castle does offer them as cheese fries which sound kind of good but cheese will only carry you so far.\n\nThere are other items at White Castle which garnered my attention. Chicken rings (whatever the heck those are), onion chips and cheese cake on a stick. Were I to go back again I would be willing to give those a shot.\n\nI can't say I am anxious to go back any time soon. To fight the crowd standing in line, paying $8.99 for a combo, trying to find a place to sit, waiting for the food and eating what they give you is just not worth the hassle of going to Fremont Street.

Look at it like a McDonalds, but a little bit more healthy and among the Asian community. Back in the early years of 2000, Lee's sandwich used to be one of my favorite pit stops every time my family and I would go to California. They USED to have one of the best BBQ pork baguettes in CA and their combination baguettes were to die for. Now, however, given the expansion of this franchise to Vegas, Lees sandwich has gone down in quality so much that the only thing worth going there for is just their coffee and 24 hr convenience.\n\nWhenever I go there to order a sandwich, it always seems like something is missing from the core. Whether it be too little meat, too little veggies, or too little sauce, it never comes out full or consistent. The meat that they use for their special combination is also tasteless, and they never seem to put enough mayo/sauce. Same goes for their BBQ pork. It has no BBQ flavors, plus is too sweet and always dry. I'm Vietnamese and I know how a proper sandwich should be made. Most Vietnamese people will tell you, It needs to have some  dashes of soy sauce in order to wrap up the flavors. However, it seems as if Lee's tried so hard to make their food Americanized for a more diverse crowd, that they made everything bland and flavorless (almost with a \"healthy\" image). On top of that, the workers making it need to be more on the same page.  Not once have I gone there did I get a sandwich that was well stuffed and not mostly bread when I take a bite. Also, the next time you buy their sandwich, try leaving it out for about 30 min before eating it. Guarantee, the baguette will be hard as a rock. Same goes for reheating the sandwiches. The outside should be CRISPY, not hard! It should not be that way!\n\nHowever, there is one thing good that I would like to give Lee's recognition for (which is also what earned it 1 more star)... Their Vietnamese ice coffee is to die for. The roast they use is very rich and deep in flavors. It is not as strong as Vietnamese coffee straight from the filters you get when you order it in pho restaurants, but the richness is definitely there. On top of that, their coffees have the perfect combination of cream at the same time. \n\nOverall, if you're not hungry, then I would definitely suggest getting their coffee (for the same price as a baguette), instead of anything else.

It did not have the velvety smooth texture of a wonderful chawan mushi due to the addition of perhaps some bonito/dashi flavoring to the base. Serving it with a overly thick soup spoon was also not a great decision as well - causing the layers to get macerated while trying to eat it. Flavor profile wise, the taste of the fish with the scant sprinkling of roasted rice puff matched well together.\n\nThe charred onion with the bonito shavings and chicken miso was another huh? dish. I suppose charring the onion from the outside gave it a nice sweet root vegetable flavor. However having a hunk of thick chicken miso paste in the middle onion sliced in half was kind of an odd choice. So you tried to mix the half charred onion with the paste on the inside while trying to get a bit of the bonito shavings with each bite but that left the parts of the dish with too much or too little of the savory paste. Taste wise, it was okay but presentation needs work.\n\nOur third courses we chose the chicken ramen and the wagyu beef burger. \n\nI was sorely disappointed by the chicken ramen. The broth while suitably thick was hopelessly lacking in chicken flavor. As a matter of fact - it was really bland and horribly under seasoned. In my humble opinion, if you can't get the broth right, it's a lose-lose situation. Although the chicken chasu and the marinated egg were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious, if the broth is bad? Forget it. Not to mention the ramen noodles were a tad over cooked. Would not recommend getting this dish.\n\nThe wagyu beef burger was a little underwhelming. First of all, the burger was medium well - emphasis on the well - which kind of defeats the purpose of using wagyu beef. The portion of the beef was overwhelmed by the large bun and the butter lettuce. This was served with some parmesan fries which were rather pedestrian.\n\nI really wanted to love this place because I love Japanese cuisine and I hope this business succeeds. However given the level of cuisine today, I cannot highly recommend this place for lunch at this time.

I don't know how many hotel visits and shows under my buffet expanded belt.  I generally stay away from the concerts and stick with magic, comics, and the various Cirque du Soleil.  As far as comparisons go, Penn & Teller is much cheaper than some, fun enough to warrant the cost, and worthwhile to check out at least once.\n\nFirst, I should state that I enjoy magic, I enjoy comedy, and this show is a nice blend of both.  It starts with a miniature jazz concert, Penn playing bass, as you listen to music to examine a box and barrel by that will be used later on in the show.  There's a lot of talk, exposition of how they came to do each trick, why they perform it, and, in some instances, what the schtick behind the trick is.  Most of their routine is very clever, simple and entertaining.  Some of it can be fairly basic (the fire eating routine, for example), but still attempts to be flashy (as it is done as a duet / light dance).  And they seem to cycle through a number of routines to keep things fresh.\n\nThis last time I saw their act, the finale concluded with an animal trap act which wasn't too bad, but was easily eclipsed by their Teller in the Tank finale they used to end with.  While I have no problem with something new, I believe their disappearing 'Elephant' trick better serves as a finale if they plan on not letting their straight man drown in a water tank.\n\nRegardless, I enjoy their style of humor (both are vocal Libertarians), their act is a nice blend of typical magic and good showmanship, include the bottom rows in more than half of their tricks, and they don't try to insult anyone's intelligence.

The rooms are spacious and the rates are generally very reasonable. It is a small hotel (300 rooms) so its easy to get in and out and the new garage connected to the hotel makes parking a breeze.\n\nHowever, this hotel recently implemented a $7.50 daily resort fee, which doesn't provide anything they didn't have BEFORE they started charging the fee, and was not disclosed to me during the reservation. Of course, you arrive the first night and the front desk tells you -- so what are you going to do. The resort fee 'includes' the shuttle service -- which runs so sporadically to begin with (doesn't start to the airport till 8am, for example) that its hardly worth it. And even when you DO adjust your schedule so you can take their shuttle (as I did to take it back from Town Square, a shuttle stop) it never shows up. I called the hotel and took me five tries to get through to an operator (it kept going to voicemail) and then ask the operator to connect me to bell desk .. which.. you guessed it... took me to voicemail.\n\nIn the end I took a cab back which wasn't too expensive, but it was the principle of paying a bogus resort fee and not even getting the 'perks' out of it. I showed my tax receipt and the night supervisor took off just enough resort fees to cover my taxi fee (which was 2/3 nights I was there). This was acceptable, though tacky -- any hotel that is service oriented would have waived the whole thing when they fail to provide the service.\n\nAnd then I get up to my room and find that they didn't even clean the room. Now I'm waiting for them to add a cleaning fee, but so far they didn't, so I called .. and was told that I left the do not disturb sign on. I know this not to be true as my wife and I came to the room several times in the day and verified it was the correct 'make up room' sign instead. So basically, instead of offering another token gesture (a free dessert? I don't know) they make up excuses and blame the guest.\n\nI will not be staying here again unless i have to and I recommend others to choose South Point which is nearby and only marginally more expensive.

I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasn't disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they weren't seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home...\n\nCame in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamari's coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Mom's fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- I'd order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I could've licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend!\n\n(*Pizza reheats well!

Please check your diets at the door. \n\nI was extremely excited to try out Hash House, because all the reviews I read made it sound so amazing. It is very hard to find a great place for breakfast in Vegas. I was tired of waiting in a huge line at Paris Buffet, so I thought it's time to go on a Man vs. Food trip. Most of the time, I cannot stand places that have too much hype. Most things that are over hyped usually suck like the Crapple iphone and Verizon's I CAN'T hear you now network. Also, In-N-Out... It's good, but not crack like most people say it is.. (I don't endorse or use crack). Even though, I tried to come here without the high expectations, it was unavoidable. I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. First off I am not a idiot! A lot of the bad reviews I read were from people that waited 2 hours and didn't like their food. I'm sorry, but if you waited 2 hours to eat anywhere I would be bitter too! I only waited 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes max, so suck on that! Haha. I went on a weekday around 9am. Brilliant!!!!\n\nI know the portions are big, but how's the quality? Did you finish dish by yourself? I don't like pigging out should I still go?\n\nThe key is bring a friend and share. The quality is good! Don't expect a 5 star restaurant or a new cuisine from a top chef. This is simple breakfast food on steroids. I highly recommend having 2 stomachs and consulting with a doctor before coming here. To my surprise the customer base was a lot smaller than I expected. The restaurant was packed shortly after I arrived, but there were no Plus sized models here. I saw some normal sized patrons and a few gorgeous model types. I really was set on trying the Sage Chicken Benedict, but since my friend was not a fan of hollandaise sauce I went with the Chicken and Waffles of course! Let's just say Roscoe's has nothing on Hash House! I thought Roscoe's clogged arteries, but Hash made Roscoe's look like a Diet Soda verses a Milk Shake. The Chicken was very juicy and extremely crispy! I really like the corn flake batter, although the spices were a bit lacking, but nothing hot sauce can't fix. The chicken cannot beat Roscoe's, but that's not a fair comparison. You definitely get 4 times the food of Roscoe's for the same price. I am very picky Fried Chicken eater, so I wish they would find some Grandma's secret recipe for Chicken so this dish could become 10 instead of a 7. The waffles with bacon inside.... Wow. A tear came to my eyes... you had me at bacon. I thought that waffles couldn't be any better, but you took my fork away! If I was lucky enough to have the genetics of Brad Pitt or LL Cool J, I would eat these waffles everyday.\n\nShould you try Hash House a Go Go? YES! Unfortunately, I only have one stomach and I could not finish half of a dish by myself. If you are a picky eater, you may want to take your snobby as$ else where. If you are a huge breakfast fan, like me, give Hash a try. Bring a huge appetite and go early. Note to self, don't order the large Orange Juice next time, it was so large I did not finish it.

We were pleasantly surprised by the decor, the wine selection, the food quality, and the taste.  It was a great meal!\n\nAs we entered the restaurant, my father-in-law and I admired the nice wine selection in the beautiful foyer.  When we were seated, I kept hearing a bump behind me in my seat, something was loose and it 'bumped' each time I moved.  Also, the acoustics are really bad in this place, so we were hearing conversations from afar and the baby sitting next to us crying was not helping.  The dry wall finishes look nice, but they reflect sounds.  I would suggest some more draperies around the place to deaden the noise.\n\nWe started off with a bottle of Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay and I had a cranberry martini, which was sweet and delicious.  Then we split off and ordered wine by the glass.  I asked the waitress for a white wine that would pair well with my meal and she brought me two wines and let me taste both before making my selection.  I chose the smoother, less fruity French wine and it turned out to be the most expensive wine on the menu.  \n\nFirst, we were given a small shrimp and orange bite-sized teaser, which was delicious.  As an appetizer, we ordered the sampler.  The pepsi shrimp was spicy-hot and delicious as was the cucumber salad it was served with.  The baby calamari with honey was amazing.  It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was out of this world.  I could've eaten a lot more of this dish.  The chicken pot stickers were also off-the-hook-yummy.  The tuna tartar was fresh and delicious as well.  Our appetizers were amazing!\n\nThen came our main courses.  My father-in-law ordered the Seared Tuna with Sea Scallop, which was served in a tomato broth.  Actually, the tuna was cooked correctly and tasted good, but it was swimming in a bowl of broth.  I've never seen this dish served this way and it displeased my father-in-law.\n\nMy mother-in-law ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin and this dish was the star of the night.  Not only was it a very generous portion, but the steak was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  Definitely one of the best steaks I've had the pleasure of tasting.  I will most definitely order this steak the next time I visit.  The mushrooms were good as were the green mashed potatoes.\n\nMy wife ordered the fish special, which was Sea Bass served with some vegetables.  It had a very delicate flavor and she really enjoyed it, seeing as it was one of the rare occasions that she orders fish and vegetables at a restaurant.\n\nFinally, I ordered the Sauteed Sea Scallops dinner, which was served with a rich, cream sauce Risotto.  The first bite was amazing, the scallops tasted delicious and seemed to be cooked correctly.  As I continued to demolish this dish, the quantity and richness of the cream sauce began to go from delicious to overpowering.  I did not finish the dish as a) it was a large portion, b) the cream sauce was far too rich, and c) there was way too much cream sauce on everything.  I wish the scallops would have been separated from the sea of overly-rich cream sauce, but alas, no one is perfect.\n\nMy father-in-law ordered a glass of port and we all shared a Creme Brulee, which was the best one I've tried yet and it was beautifully presented.   Actually, the presentation of the dishes alone is worth the trip to this place.  They were each meticulously crafted and were all beautiful in their own way.  I took some photos and will post them soon.\n\nThe bill came to $255.00 with several drinks and tip for four.

The attention to detail, the room and the service have been excellent every time I have dined here.  They have a nice variety of ( mostly Northern) Italian food.

The steaks and seafood are still exclusive to the room and a nice addition for groups where people in a party want something other than Italian food. \n\nI switch it up now and then but I like the Cappellini Pomodoro and Ravioli the best for my entree. The caprese  is a very large portion and has very nice flavor. The minestrone soup tastes very fresh  as well. \n\nFor dessert I could almost pick blindly and really like  anything I pick since I've tried everything. My very favorite is Zabaglione & Fresh Berries. It is light, flavorful and a perfect way to end a nice meal with along with some Fernet-Branca or a chilled Sambuca. \n\nThe only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the marinara sauce and other red sauces are good but not great.

But to keep it real, I did like the business, but location wise can probably be in a better setting.  \n\nLocated on Sahara Ave, in between Lynnwood and S Van Patten St. You'll see a big two story orange building with blue poles. Mainly on the second floor, next to TAM of Nevada is the ABC Bartending school. It may be confusing at first, but its convenient. I did like the fact that next door was TAM of Nevada, where we don't have to go far to get our TAM card. It is a small area, but it is big enough for 8 bartenders to be up and learning at the same time. Of course, classes may be at least doubled, or even less then 8 bartenders. But they do have classes every week. You can take one week, 6 hours a day, or you can two weeks, 3 hours a day. Its depends on your schedule, and they do have classes in the morning, afternoon and evening. \n\nMy experience, I took the two weeks course in the afternoon. I thought it would be cool to check out the Bartending world, and see if I could get my foot in the door some where. So I tried it, I got a chance to learn a lot of drink making, get some hints on how to remember drinks. Figuring out the pouring and understanding which glass is for which drink. Also understanding the job duties of the bartender, what not to do, and what is expected of you, either by opening the bar or closing the bar. All that is taught to you during your schooling. You will also get some index cards to keep, so you can always refer to drinks, either that you forgotten or just making sure your doing it correctly. After your schooling, you can always come back and practice and be able to get job leads that will help you in the right direction. \n\nI know some schools may teach flairing, or how to juggle a bottle in a fancy way. But this school is focusing on making drinks, which I like about. I know other schools may have their own method, but ABC Bartending makes sure you get a good understanding of your job duties. You can probably learn flairing on your own time, but not all casinos or bars allow flair. \n\nI would recommend this, if you really want to get an understanding on making drinks and trying to get into the Bartending world. If you don't mind the confined space, but if you think about it, some places are confined to small working area. ABC Bartending is probably a good way to get a good understanding of the Bartending World.

I should have ate it there to see if it was flaky but I was full after my waffle sandwich.

But given that we had theater tickets one Friday night, the time was finally right to sample Byblos' much-ballyhooed wares.\n\nWe arrived at around 6:15 and we promptly shown to our reserved table near the front. Our very helpful waitress appeared shortly after and we began the slow process of figuring out just what to eat. We ultimately chose six items:\n\nDuck Kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): This was easily the highlight of the entire meal. I've eaten plenty of kibbeh over my lifetime but this is unquestionably the tastiest version of this venerable dish I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the delectable spices to the unctuous, melt-in-your-mouth meat to the note-perfect sauce. Just astounding.\n\nSpanish Octopus (fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon): Although the octopus was cooked about as well as I've ever had it - the octopus at Bar Isabel, for example, was far chewier - there was nothing about this dish that really stood out. Perhaps it's because it came on the heels of the sublime Duck Kibbeh, but there was nothing here that really blew me away in terms of flavor - although the presentation was quite nice.\n\nSujuk Pide (turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar): I'm a big fan of sujuk (a spicy Middle Eastern sausage), so I was especially excited about this one. It's very good. All the components work extremely well together and the enveloping crust is baked perfectly. I suppose my one complaint is the sujuk itself, which, in addition to not tasting like any sujuk I've ever had, is completely lacking in the heat I've come to associate with the sausage.\n\nMejadra (lentil + hung yogurt + fried shallot): Again, this is something I've been eating my entire life and I have to say, unfortunately, that this dish just didn't measure up. Despite the aforementioned dollop of yogurt, the rice is just dry as heck. It's been cooked in a skillet, which allows the side and bottom rice to get crispy - an idea which sounds great in theory but doesn't really work here. Far more problematic is the fried shallot on top. Traditionally, the shallots (or onions) are taken beyond the point of caramelization, which lends the dish a rich flavor that's unfortunately completely absent here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment for me.\n\nSeared Cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): This is a very tasty side that's almost workmanlike in its execution. It's well done but it's nothing special, sadly.\n\nTurkish Manti Dumplings (smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses): This incredibly rich dish admittedly goes well with the Mejadra, as it cuts that dryness I mentioned. But it might be just a little too rich; between the heavy yogurt sauce and the sweet molasses, it's impossible to taste the smokey eggplant supposedly contained within the dumplings.\n\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed my meal at Byblos. The ambiance is inviting, the service is flawless, and the food is, for the most part, quite above average.

Emilee has more hair than anyone else I know... so I figured hey, if she can tame that lovely blonde head of hair... she can do anything. :)\n\nErica does a great job. She takes the time for a thorough consultation before pulling out the scissors and dye. I trust her completely and always leave happy. I also recommend Corey.

However, the celebration was nearly ruined... you see, if you want to make a large group reservation at the restaurant, you need to put down a $100 deposit in order to hold it, and if you need to cancel it you will get it back in the form of a gift card.  I don't necessarily agree with it, but I made the reservation anyway since I didn't think we would cancel it.

He's like yeah I don't know, but we don't have a table.  So I told him to wait til I get there to sort things out.  \n\nSo I got there and they managed to put together some tables for our group, but the actual table that we were supposed to be sitting at in the quieter, less busy part of the restaurant was given to another group.  I was not impressed.  Then our server Genessa comes over and greets us with the $100 gift card, welcoming us... to which I was quite confused.  My name and reservation date was written on the gift card, but my reservation was actually not recorded in the book.  Sure, the hostess came by to check the gift card receipt to see who charged me and who took down the reservation, but that was it.  I wasn't expecting a free meal, but something more should've been done.  A large group of 9 with a baby in the busiest part of the restaurant was not ideal seating (the DB behind me slammed his chair into mine when he got up - no apology either).

She was a fantastic server and we did end up enjoying our evening.\n\nYou can count on the food at NOtaBLE to be good, however the whole reservation thing really left a bad taste in my mouth.

It's pretty big so bring your appetite if you're going to be ordering this dish. There is a fried chicken breast nestled between two waffles and some bacon. The chicken is the perfect amount of crispy and juicy. You also get syrup which makes the waffle easier to bite into.

Whenever I go to a new sushi restaurant, wherever I am, I ask if they have Toro. A restaurant that has Toro in the first place, is a good sign. Then, a restaurant that has good Toro is obscure. A restaurant with amazing Toro, is a restaurant you frequent.  2 pieces of toro nigiri is be pure heaven if it iswhat they say it is.  I have been to several restaurants that gave me \"Toro\" and it obviously wasn't... or it was a pitiful example of such. Toro is the belly/neck of the fish. It's the part of the fish that gets very little excercise (relatively) compared to the rest of the fish. So this meat is rich in buttery fat that you can see wet on the meat like little beads of oil. And unlike normal blue fin tuna which is reddish in color. The fat in toro gives it a lighter, closer to pink/white color.  Well needless to say Kiku was serving up some crazy good toro when we went... at like 8, on a Sunday night. \n\nThe rest of the meal was great. I felt bad coming in at 8 on a Sunday but we sat in the bar, there were other people there chatting with the bartender, and the waitress made us feel very welcome.  This seemed to be a no frills sushi joint, which is just fine with me.  We are about the fish.  Their maki rolls seemed to be limited but we had a roll and the sashimi platter which was very impressive.  The platter had egg, octopus, mackerel, tuna, salmon, yellow tail, and one other I think. Pretty impressive selection for like 25 dollars.\n\nThe cut of the sushi, the size of the cut, the temperature of the fish are all extremely important factors in perfect sushi and Kiku sushi did a mighty fine job in all regards.

Really nice, ice cold (but not icy) cucumbers with a sweet vinegar dressing and toasted black sesame seeds. Delicious, crisp, refreshing. Maybe a little bit too sweet, and maybe could have used a little bit more sesame seed, but really a nice start. \n\nI ordered both a roll and a hot plate - the roll was the waiter recommended Shibuya Roll. Soft shell crab, fresh jalapeno, spicy albacore, and scallion. Very good, even with the scallion on top. The crab was nice and sweet, with a very light batter, and the jalapeno, although odd sounding, provided good heat that really wasn't all too different from what you get in your typical spicy tuna roll. I would tend to blame that on the quality of the pepper - either it's lost in the roll, or it didn't have much jalapeno flavor, just a little mild heat. Either way, this was worth getting, even as I was drawn to the Hanabi roll with its green apple. \n\nThe entree was the also recommended Australian lobster and day boat scallops in uni butter sauce. This was simply outstanding. Sweet, succulent, delicious lobster, as close to what I remember having at Tru, and very well cooked scallops (of which only one was the tiniest bit gritty), all in a delicious, and likely heart healthy sauce. All of this was on a little rice, and with edamame, baby carrot, and heirloom cherry tomatoes, which were pleasantly cooked hot, but still crisp skinned. All of this was just an amazing combo. I found myself expending the effort to chopstick individual grains of rice out of the leftover sauce. \n\nAs I was dining alone (really fun, I know) I opted to sit at the sushi bar, which is one of the better ones I've sat at.

My steak was at least two inches in height, and cooked perfectly - and I mean perfectly. This was my first dry aged steak and I now understand why this process is desired by many. It adds a flavor that cannot be duplicated by using seasoning. The flavor was fantastic. Every bite was just a beautiful harmony between sips of my Italian wine.

First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.

They had a very good selection, all on display, from inexpensive portable models through the Sony-Pioneer-Denon range up to a few very high-end models. I browsed around a little in the other audio sections, and they seemed to be similar in selection and price ranges. They also have a wide range of other products from video to car stereo to cell phones and lots of accessories.\n\nI ended up buying the Pioneer model that evening because it was the last day of the sale, but the salesman was nice enough to hold it for me until I could pick it up the next day, which was also easy even though that salesman was not there.

The dining area is open and there is even a stage for karaoke!  The decor is very oriental restaurant-ish, but the tanks of fish and crustaceans are a nice touch.\n\nIt was refreshing to look over the menu and see every dish that I loved from our old Chinese restaurant.  My group ordered our standard Chinese dinner: sizzling rice soup, walnut shrimp, beef chow fun (dry), crispy chicken, kung pao chicken and fried rice.  Our soup arrived promptly and it was like a big warm chinese hug.  All the memories from Silver dragon came flooding back.  We had barely finished the soup when our food came rushing out, but that's what I expect from chinese food.  Words cannot describe the deliciousness that I experienced.  I had a bizarre flashback the moment the warm creamy shrimp and crunchy candied walnut hit my tongue.  I felt a tingle rush up my spine and I knew that I would be hooked on this restaurant.  The beef chow fun was a perfect balance of saltiness, meatiness, and the oh-so good charred/smokiness that comes from a fast stir-fry over a jet engine stove.  The crispy chicken was sublime combination of texture and taste.  And the kung pao was also good, but we order that just for some spice.\n\nAll in all, it was a surprisingly great dinner.\n\nP.S.\nAfter the fantastic dinner, we went back for dim sum lunch and it was also unbelievable.  The place was packed with people but we got a table right away.\n\nImmediately after we were seated the food frenzy started.  I was surprised at the wide array of dim sum offered, some of which I didn't think I could find outside of San Francisco.\n\nThe chicken feet were spicy, sweet, and tender.  The shrimp toasts were superbly buttery and crunchy.  The tripe soup was amazing.  The ha gau were delicate and perfectly balanced.  The Lotus-leaf rice was delicious.

Being conjoined with Paris meant that as you walked inside and down the escalator from the parking lot into the main halls you were invited by Parisian facades and spectacle that is Vegas; however, it is classy and doesn't try to overwhelm you with senses. Instead the show element melded with just enough sophistication to give you luxury that didn't over- or underwhelm you.\n\nCasino Floor Deco - 4\n\nI still find their styling and design so refreshing and classical without looking too dated. Like a fine, middle grade wine, this casino floor is aging well. The ceilings are still clean. The tables are in good condition and the dress code for the dealers is still a classic look of dress shirts and vests. It's no Cosmopolitan, and truly nothing anywhere in Vegas is, but this isn't a budget casino.\n\nHotel Room Deco - 3\n\nWalking into the hotel room and you can start to see how the years have taken a toll. For the most part the rooms are standard and I mean that in the most general way. From the dark wood stain to the set up of the TV cabinet and bed tables there is nothing fancy about it. It's a basic setup and it works well. Some of the wallpaper in the bathroom has seen better days and the bathing supplies given complimentary isn't necessarily the greatest either but the rooms work. Enough to keep you comfortable and also keep you out to enjoy the rest of Vegas.\n\nPrice - 3\n\nThe pricing for Bally's in my opinion is very fair. Because they are more of a middle range casino their prices will usually range in the lower side compared to places like the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, and The Linq (all located in the periphery of Bally's). With such a great location Bally's really is a great place to call home base yet still get to see all Vegas has to offer around it for a budget price.\n\nCasino - 4\n\nBy no means is Bally's the largest casino floor but it is all placed and located even through a floor that can be seen easily from the lobby. It has every game you might want and some you don't. It is a place where you can find your friends easily if you get lost and not such an eyesore where you want to seek refuge outside as soon as possible. For the most part the dealers are quite pleasant and if you get onto the right table you might have a nice conversation if nothing else.\n\nConclusion\n\nBally's will always have a place in my heart because of the wonderment it brought me when I first arrived to Vegas. With the easy transport from Bally's to Paris and the eye candy in between it really is a great casino to stay for any frugal traveler looking for a good room with enough money remained to paint the town.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "We were in the mood for bean dip (and we wanted to use our coupon for a free cheese crisp from Yelp so of course Garcia's was our only option :) \n\nThe cheese crisp was super cheesy (definitely a plus) and made even better with the variety of salsas to top it with.

Besides, you're here for pizza; ambiance is secondary.\n\nAnd the pizza is good. I went with the 'Rossoverde' and it was a great choice. The crust is thin and simple -- crispy where it should be and chewy where it should be, too. The sauce was light, flavorful and savory; in reality, it's little more than crushed tomatoes and its all the better for it. The cheese, prosciutto and sauce were all in balance and the pie was blanketed in arugula; it was as if a salad was served on top.

The only reason I'd break cycle would probably be having to go to the dealership for something in particular or if I was having my oil change done out of province which isn't often.\n\nWhat are the advantages of going to Mr. Lube versus getting your oil change anywhere else?  What does Mr. Lube offer?  They offer a variety of services having to do with a vehicle's regular maintenance.  This includes oil changes, as well as filters, flushes, belts, wipers, batteries, undercoating and other fluid related services and can rotate tires even.\n\nWhat makes Mr. Lube different than say bringing your car to the dealer or other garages would be that you don't have to exit your vehicle.  You essentially drive into the garage, turn off your car and are offered a newspaper, something to drink and you can stay in your car during the entire process.\n\nThere is no appointment necessary and for the price of an oil change your fluids and other items get a complete inspection.  Tire pressure is checked, all lights are checked, health of battery, acid in coolant, color of fluids, clean filters, even your doors hinges are lubricated.\n\nWhile there have been mentions of upselling all this is just advice and you can take it or leave it.  There is no obligation to get any service done beyond what you came in for however if your transmission fluid isn't the right color they will show it to you.  If your filter is black they will bring it to you to see etc.  \n\nYour vehicle has a schedule of what services it needs to have according to regular maintenance checks such as a cycle for a coolant change is X amount of KM's but they will still check it for acid levels.\n\nNobody likes to have to spend money on their car but maintaining it essential to keeping it healthy and operational.  While Mr. Lube offers a variety of car maintenance services, they also do it in a quick and convenient environment.  You don't have to leave your car there, in fact you don't have to even get out of your car.  \n\nMuch information about how your vehicle is doing is checked by a team of technicians in a short period of time.  The condition of your fluids, filters and other things can easily be shown to you first hand so basically everything is transparent because they are performing the service in your presence.  \n\nWhile they make recommendations for service I do not feel pressured to have to perform anything and opt out on some from time to time for certain things that can be stretched.\n\nThe service is always fast and friendly regardless of the tech I get since they pretty much all follow a pretty standard way of doing things.  \n\nI've been pretty happy with how Mr. Lube has helped me take care of my vehicle through out the years and it's done quickly which is good because I don't have the time to leave my car at the dealer unless it's something major and I would prefer not having to waiting for oil changes.

I normally don't comment on value but this place is so good and so well priced that I want to come back here a lot when I'm not looking for a celebratory fancier place.  \n\nEvery Toronto neighbourhood needs a restaurant like Chantecler. A restaurant that embodies the best of the area,creates very good food at a reasonable price, and keeps you coming back.  Its YOUR neighbourhood restaurant... the only one that stands out for consistent good service and awesome plates.  It's too bad I dont live W Queen W or Parkdale cause I would love this place to be mine!\n\nI came on a Sunday evening during the long weekend and we were one of the first ones in the restaurant.  The place isnt big but the front windows completely open up to the streets allowing a lot of gorgeous light and also fresh air into the space.

It was comfortable enough that we didnt feel like we had to overhear neighbouring tables.  \n\nThe service here was spot on for a place like this... authentically warm, friendly, helpful, and interested in creating a good experience.  We werent too sure how much to order but were told that one or two platters with a few snacks, sides, and appetizers to fill it out would be more than enough for our small group.

It offers really good food at very reasonable prices that fills you up and you leave happy.  It's not like some of the hipster places near Ossington where you wonder where half of the serving went (hello Good Son... 2 loonie sized scallops is not an entree at $25!).  Like I said... Chantecler needs to be in every hood in Toronto... including Ossington.\n\nWe ordered a fair bit with 2 orders of their own beer and it only came up to $80 before tip!

This was a nice opening as who can say no to warm cheesy carbs.  I would have appreciated if it had more of a cheesy flavour. 3.5/5\n\nKale and Roasted Squash Salad - Nicely dressed kale salad that had 2 good sweet roasted slices of squash, pieces of poached sweet pear. Generous shaving of Parmesan to bring salty flavours.  And some pumpkin seeds to bring the crunch.  it's a solid and generous helping for all the adults at the table.  4/5\n\nChicken Pate - Ok, this was soo ridiculously creamy.  A super generous serving of rich buttery chicken liver pate that was accompanied with a sweet tomato jam, crunchy radishes, and tart acidic pickles.  Put everything together and you get a burst of delicious crunchy, smooth, creamy, sweet, sour, and tart.  I cannot tell you how many times we all commented how good this was.  This is enough for 3+ adults to share... easily.  But you probably dont want to even though your doctor would recommend it.  Kudos to the service who did bring a 2nd plate of bread to help use up all the great pate.  5/5\n\nSausage and Pork Platter - This is another dish that completely surprised on how good it can be.  The pork served looks like a loin but it's really the pork shoulder rolled up in a rollade and then pan seared to the point the ends are crispy like a bacon while the interior is a tender bite.  We were all amazed because we expected dry loin with the exterior looking that crisp... totally pleasantly surprised.  Probably one of the best pork I've had this year.  The sausage was ok... a bit dry but the pork shoulder... ORDER IT!  The accompanying apple sauce and grainy mustard are just perfect to give that sour and sweet.  Another winner 5/5\n\nBrussel Sprouts with Bacon - I like this a lot ... it has bacon.  I think thats enough to convince anyone to try this.  It's wonderful generous serving for $6 and satisfied the entire table for some green vegetables.  Minor issue would be some of the sprouts were a bit big and not cooked through to tender.  4/5\n\nFries - French fries are done pretty good here.  I think we got this cause we love how someone at the table thought French Fries are French when they were really young.  It could have been cooked a bit crispier as some pieces were still tender and pale instead of crispy.  3.5/5\n\nThe Pork and Chicken Pate were really well done and the price point makes this an affordable option any day of the week.

We were the first ones there, but by the time we left an hour later, the place was packed.\n\nI ordered a chicken pad thai, and both my friend and his friend ordered the cashew chicken.  Food came out at a reasonable time.  My pad thai was piping hot.  I had ordered it without the oyster sauce, just to make sure, as I am allergic to shellfish.  So it did taste a bit different, like something was missing.  But I think it was still good and they are very generous with the chicken.  I even had my left overs the next day, and it was still pretty tasty  My friend also agreed, that the lack of oyster sauce made the dish taste a bit off.  All three of us enjoyed the cashew chicken.  Really well done and VERY generous portions.  I feel like the dish can easily feed two people, but my friend and his friend easily ate it to themselves lol.  Sooo, it depends on which two people you're trying to feed.\n\nService was great.  While we were sitting waiting for the food, my friend's friend dropped his spoon and before we could even ask for another one, they already had a clean one at our table.  Dayum.  That's service lol.

The Stubby side is more like a neighborhood bar and was pretty busy and loud, the Corks side was more upscale looking (they had little slices of cucumber in the water!) and quiet.

Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and informative, giving some great suggestions for what to eat, and it was interesting to learn he had grown up in New Zealand. \n\nFor the food we started with the Reuben Egg Rolls. Nothing spectacular, but they were good. Probably would have been a better presentation if they had cut the two rolls in half at an angle on a plate instead of serving two thick rolls in one of those Asian carryout containers that then get thrown away. On a higher note, I was really happy with the Elk Burger and rosemary fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and everything tasted great! My dining companion got this chicken dish in a lemon sauce with a heaping mound of mashed potatoes. They seemed to really like their dish as well. \n\nWe shut the place down since we were there for four hours and were the last customers to leave, (they had to unlock the door for us to get out), but all of the staff were friendly and had no qualms about us enjoying our time there while they cleaned up. Oh and at one point we did move to the Stubby side where they were playing 90's music which I enjoyed trying to remember the lyrics to.

We discussed a dozen regular cupcakes in center to make main part of cake and  minis all around.\n\nThey are nut free and will do other customizations too but are honest about taste difference and if they recommend doing it.\n\nMy only complaint, is that I really wanted a red velvet as one of the flavors but Half Baked won't do it due to the food coloring it takes.Did I mention their strawberry frosting is made with real strawberries and not just pink coloring?\n\nI am strongly leaning towards using this bakery for my daughter's birthday and think I can't really go wrong with the vanilla, chocolate and lemon-I am just greedy.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Came on a Sunday around 5pm, so not incredibly busy.

The refried beans could use some improvement. Okay, so I am Hispanic and have been eating beans since birth and I have never had beans so watered down. It was more of a cold bean soup. Maybe that's what La Condesa was going for, but that didn't work for me either. The rice was good and warm.  \n\nI enjoyed the salsa bar.

We didn't venture outside the general strip/ major tourist areas too much, but decided we had to check this off our bucket list before we left based on the great reviews. \n\n- Seating: Luckily, we arrived fairly early near the opening hours so our party of four was seated upon arriving. Shortly after, more people began arriving and there was quickly a line that formed for seating. We sat at the bar/ counter, so we could see the desserts as they were being made. \n\n- Desserts: We decided to go for all of the main desserts after trying their three most popular desserts. Each desert came out to $12 on its own. \n\nThe first we tried was the Ichigo (Balloon Shaped Thin White Chocolate Cup filled with Pie Crust and Strawberry Mousse, served with Strawberry Candy filled with Strawberry Sorbet and Condensed Milk Mousse). This was by far my favorite, from the creation, presentation and taste. It was certainly 'gram worthy and felt like a party exploded in your mouth each time you took a bite! If you had to choose just one dessert from Sweets Raku, get this! \n\nNext we got the Mars (Yuku Mousse and Chocolate Cream with Hazlenuts and Assorted Fruits covered with White Chocolate Piece Flamb\u00e9ed with Brandy). This was my second favorite order and again was well presented. They pour a hot syrup on top from a gold glass over the dessert which melts the perfectly rounded dessert to expose the ingredients inside -- kind of like a planet exploding to reveal it's inner deliciousness. \n\nThen we got the Miyabi (Green Tea Souffl\u00e9, Vanilla Ice Cream and Seasonal Fruits in a Green Tea Cookie Wicker Basket, Served with Kumquat Sauce). This was my third favorite, it was an interesting and unique taste with a bit more bitter taste than the other dishes but complimented well with the sweetness of other flavors. The various textures like crunchiness also added another layer. This would be great for those that prefer a dish that isn't overtly on the sweet side. \n\nAfter receiving the aforementioned desserts, we decided to just complete the rest of the menu with two additional dessert dishes -- in hindsight we wish we hadn't as the following two weren't as great in their taste. \n\nThe Angel Cream (Fromage Blanc Mousse and Pear Mousse with Earl Grey Cookies and Dark Chocolate) was absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch being made with a special carefulness and precision. However, the taste which was unique and combined interesting flavors, wasn't at all to our liking. The last dish we got was the Mt. Fuji (Chestnuts Cream with Fluffy Sponge Cake). This was also interesting to watch being made, with spaghetti like dessert noodles being spurned out and spices dashed on top. This was very bitter and again, not very tasty in my opinion. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience at Sweets Raku, one that was heightened by our sitting at the bar and watching how each dessert dish was carefully made with care by the chefs. The dishes were well portioned and we were easily able to share each one amongst our party of four. For those trying Sweets Raku for the first time, I'd recommend trying just two to three of the desserts in the following order: Ichigo, Mars and Miyabi.

Definitely worth an hour or two of your life to wander through the store! \n\nIf you're looking for a specific item, call ahead or go straight to an employee for help. While items are grouped together by type (cookies, fruit, noodles, spices), not everything is organized logically. Sometimes you'll find foods stored together by country (Vietnamese foods, Thai foods, etc), but certain ingredients will be in another part of the store. Ask for help if you're unsure. Large selection of beer and booze that is reasonably priced. Produce is always fresh and you'll find a much larger variety than an American supermarket. If you eat a lot of rice, buy in bulk (giant bags are right by the entrance).  \n\nThey have a jewelry store inside the supermarket, but I've never purchased anything there. One section of Lee Lee Market has trinkets, home decor, and traditional oriental items that you can give as gifts.

The three floors of space mean that there's plenty of space to meet with friends or go for dinner with the family (kids are welcome until 9 pm as per AGLC regulations). While each floor has large bar area with plenty of taps for 'beers to come', each differs in style. \nThe first thing you notice when you walk in the main level front door is the super cool, mesmerizing overhead conveyor belt upon which empty growlers weave their way throughout the main floor seating area before disappearing to the basement level where all the cool kids go (because there's a hot bartender...I'm looking at you beardy man!). The main bar is situated along the far wall and the seating is comfortable and not too packed together. The street level patio area will be the perfect spot to sip beer while people watching.\nDownstairs, there's a large U shaped bar with seating and the surrounding tables. It's dark, it's a bit quieter, and it has peek a boo windows into the ladies toilets. Don't worry, you're not exposed...but you do have a view of the brewing tanks!\nThe very top floor is more of a 'dining area' with large yellow padded booths and a gorgeous bar-style seating area overlooking the avenue.

We were eager to try a new Indian restaurant, having been regulars at every previous one in town. We arrived at 4:30 for Sunday afternoon service, right when it begins. \n\nPre-service: The doors were open, but the lights were off and no one came out to greet us. After five minutes, a staff member walking through saw us and went to find someone in the kitchen. This person came out and told us to seat ourselves. We did. A few minutes later, a waiter came and asked us to move to another table. That waiter took our order, but returned some minutes later to say they were out of lamb (we had both ordered lamb dishes). We switched to chicken. I had ordered a beer (draft Samuel Adams lager), but that service was delayed for some time. Another customer (a teenage girl) asked if they had wifi, but their waiter said the wifi was out. \n\nAppetizers: Finally, food began to come, with appetizers first. Those were good -- we ordered the chili chicken (which is served as is traditional with sauteed sliced onions and peppers with an eighth of lime to squeeze over the top) and the aloo tiki -- fried mashed potato patties. Both dishes were tasty -- mildly spiced but flavorful and well executed. I would order both of these dishes again. The chili chicken at Sitara is a little more to our preference because it has more acid, but this is a fine point -- I would gladly eat either version. To drink, we were also given room-temperature water, which is standard at Indian restaurants. \n\nThree sauces were served at the table with the appetizers and remained for the rest of the meal. These were tamarind sauce, mint chutney, and a sour hot sauce. We liked all three. \n\nDecor & Atmosphere: Plastic water glasses, china dishes, metal flatware. The decor is a variation of Escobar's but appropriate re-accessorized. Fairly plain, but clean and functional. We found the lighting somewhat dim (from the overhead pendant lamps) -- the staff re-adjusted the lighting levels several times during our meal. In nearby booths, there was also some blue strip lighting which seemed more appropriate for Kofusion and didn't \"go\" with the rest of the decor. Initially the music was coffeehouse, but later changed to Indian pop music.\n\nEntrees: For our entrees, we ordered chicken vindaloo and chicken garlic marsala. We have had these dishes at many other restaurants, including versions at Sitara in Urbana. We thought that these were well made, but we like Sitara's versions better. At Kohinoor, the chicken was very tender, and the sauces had a good amount of flavor with the expected spice profile. However, the chicken vindaloo was not hot (in terms of spice) and did not have the tartness we've come to expect of a good vindaloo. The vegetable in the dish was broccoli florets. Similarly, the garlic marsala did not taste very garlicky and the marsala was overwhelmed with a tomato-based sweetness. The sauce to meat ratio was also a little off. These were wetter than usual renditions of these dishes. Even so, the amount of each serving was a reasonable value and the quality was very good. We ordered raita to accompany our entrees and it too was delicious (a smooth version, very loose, and sour as well as slightly sweet -- a good accompaniment that would be even better if the food were spicier).\n\nBread: I am a bread lover, and so as usual I ordered two types of flat bread to try. This time it was onion kulcha and naan with green chilis. We loved both. Each flatbread was big, warm, and flavorful. The vegetable flavors were pungent and delicious. We love the bread at Sitara as well, but here Kohinoor has a little edge. The restaurant space also has more seating than Sitara and isn't packed so close together, which is a plus.\n\nSummation and Post-service: Kohinoor's grand opening is on Valentine's Day. For still being early in their service, the restaurant is doing a decent job. If I were able to advise them, I'd suggest they step up their game in the pre and post service. It also took us a very long time to get our check, pay, and get out the door once we were finished eating. We weren't sure why there was a delay, since we'd had good service during the meal once it had begun. I'd also advise them to spice up their dishes or at least to offer that option to diners who have an affinity for authentic Indian cuisine. \n\nWe're glad to have Kohinoor as another option for Indian dining in town.

My friend and I shared the Lobster Pici and the Short Rib and bone marrow agnolotti.

It's still a solid pool party but here's the rundown if you decide to get bottle/table service.  The prices all vary depending on your promoter. You're best finding a staff member of EBC to get you table reservations, they have so much more pull with what they can provide you as it's a first come first serve when it comes to location of your table service.  Minimum this weekend was $1k tables and those were for couches far away.   We opted for a Lilly pad (and were quoted about $3K) and lucky for us one of our friends had come early and reserved it. You can choose to get bottles to meet your minimum or you can just do total food and drinks. Patron Silver went for ~$700. Bottles are poured into carafes and then placed into the ice buckets. The mixers were flowing and the ice was changed out often. \n\nYou have to be your own bouncer when it comes to your table/Lilly pad area. Security walks around more than takes care of the reservation areas.  So many bottle rats/leeches, it kinda got annoying.  \n\nMusic was ok.

The noodle soups, like the satay beef noodle soup, while big on wonton noodles instead of the instant noodles usually served in this staple dish, could use a bolder hit of satay beef flavor, and the shrimp wonton could benefit with a bit less pork and more shrimp. There is a surprising Sichuan menu, perhaps a nod to the increasingly mainland Chinese student population unfamiliar with Hong Kong style cuisine, but one item on there, the house special beef steak, #108, will have to await future reviews, as with the dessert menu. \n\nOn the whole we would continue to come back just for the baked rice dishes and noodle dishes alone, but hope for the continuous improvement of the menu. 3.5 stars.

Not  a big deal, but IMHO, the server should have stated up front that while it wasn't available as a \"halfsie\", it could be ordered as sides..I am not sure if my side of hash was the same portion as a full order or if it was less/ more. \n\nQuick credit card processing by Britt completed the dining experience.

They were drizzled with the remoulade and aioli and they were delish. I think that the tomatoes could have been a bit of a thicker slice but overall they were filling. I think also for the price there could have been maybe double the amount of tomatoes on the plate. Green tomatoes are not that expensive and with them being so thin, add a few more to the plate!\n\nAndouille Gumbo: This was dang tooting good. I think I could have licked the plate clean and I even mentioned to the waitress to not be shocked if she saw me licking the bowl. The rue that the gumbo was made in was spot on, the sausage tasted amazing, and the who experience was magnificent.

I picked the Oyster po' boy because oysters are one of my favorite foods and fried oysters as just amazing. The po' boy came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles. I added extra tomatoes and onions to my sandwich because I am difficult and I love tomatoes and onions. I will say that standard the sandwich comes with fries, The waitress said we could sub it out for any of the sides on the menu. Again this is where good service comes in. I asked her how the coleslaw was because I am a bit of a coleslaw snob. I do not like like weird coleslaw or slaw that is made with miracle whip (which is disgusting in my book). She went to the back and got me a little serving dish of the coleslaw for me and Greg to try. That is wonderful service. I hated it so was grateful for her allowing me to try it out. I went with the mixed veggies instead. I will say, I asked what the veggies were and she told me broccoli, carrots, and something else. When it came out it was just zucchini, squash, and onions. Not at all my jam. I ate them and looked longingly at Greg's fries. I would not have picked that as a nice side veggie to eat but since I ate all the fried food, it was ok. I will also say that the veggies were caked in butter. They must be steamed or cooked in a ton of butter. I was a little taken aback by the amount of butter in the bowl, but just kind of went with it. \n\nThe service and the food were wonderful. I would come back any day.

I turned on some music, and pup and I lounged on the couch waiting our turn. \n\nThe nurse who came in first was super sweet and was gentle with my puppy. She was thorough in her questions and answered  all my concerns. Shortly after, the doctor came in and discussed the evaluation options with me. Both were honest in their approach and not pushy in any way with what treatment I decided. After the nurse came in, I was in and out and about an hour- not bad considering they told me another ER patient came in (dog hit by car, scared and running from fireworks) and they had to tend to him/her. \n\nUltimately, they were able to have my puppy feeling better and sent me home with some free food to stabilize his stomach. \n\nI will definitely return.\n\nAs far as price point, ER pet visits aren't cheap, but I think the visit price was reasonable for being, late at night and a holiday.

Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour.\n\nCommunication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint.  After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls.  \n\nWe signed up for the One Hour Tour.  John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base.  It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle.  However, a few of the gals did not.  \n\nGirls - be smart, not stupid.  Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer.  It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon.  You'll die.  Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body.  Bring a light long sleeved shirt.  The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms.  Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals.  Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4-wheeler.  The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine.\n\nLast, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex (i.e. toilet paper), chapstick and a bandana.  While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person.  It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me.  I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt.\n\nNow, onto the tour.  I thought it was amazing.  The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys - they know what they are doing.  They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow.  They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV.  They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills.  As you become more comfortable with the ATV,  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time.  They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful.

I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding.

So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour.\n\nI winded up flying over a \"Witch's Eye\" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars.  I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar.  It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it.  The staff was great - they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back.  I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day...and today...I am still so happy I did the tour.  It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide.

I didn't expect Dr. Kelley to hold my hand and tell me everything was going to be ok - instead he explained that he would remove my old scar altogether and make it look better. And he did. \n\nMy second delivery (in 2013) via c-section was a dream compared to the first. I initially went into labor 6 days early on my own to which the triage nurses ended up calling him in the middle of the night and by the time he got there, my contractions subsided but since he was already there, he said \"Let's have a baby!\"  I don't know what he did different but it was practically painless!  I couldn't have been more happy!\n\nMy third (in 2016) was even better. He made sure that I was comfortable while I was in the hospital recovering and even let me leave a day early. \n\nI delivered at Summerlin for each of my kids and Dr. Kelley was amazing for my last two.

Pizza delicious, everything fresh took the one with the most ingredients. After a cold beer with my pizza I'm way to pleased to leave.  Order a glass of house red. Mr. Everything offered me a taste before he pours, too enamoured to care at this point.  Chef asks me how my pizza was and if he can  pack it for me.  Smile after smile.  I needed this so bad.  A kiss of what things should be.   Most welcome I have felt in a long ass time.  \n.......\nAfter I wrote this on my phone notes I got to know the entire team.

It surely won't disappoint. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here hungry on a Sunday. We had never been. There was many people waiting in the lobby area. It took us maybe 20-30 minutes to get seated during mid-morning rush hours. They seemed like they were able to accommodate large parties. So, that's good to know. \n\nOur server was dressed in a llama pajama outfit. It was AWESOME. She was friendly and attentive, even though they were very busy. She made recommendations about her favorite food. My only slight annoyance was that she didn't tell us that we were ordering WAY, WAY too much food. However, that's still okay. It was worth trying all of it.\n\nWe ordered the Country Friend New York Steak & Eggs, Buffalo-Style Crispy Chicken Breasts & Eggs, and Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes. For two of us. \n\nAll of it was fantastic. Again, if I have not made it clear enough, the portions were massively colossal to epic proportions. Yes, too much food. It was all very tasty though. We didn't want to stop eating, even though there was no dent made in the food. Hashtag, leftovers...\n\nOverall, super awesome breakfast joint. The only possible set back is that it did take awhile to get our food once ordered. I would say 20-30 minutes, but if you're not in a rush, it is definitely worth the wait. Super happy customer here!

They also have some odd amenities because this hotel was supposed to be Condos. My kitchenette had a dishwasher, microwave and quite a bit of empty cabinet space. The bed is VERY comfortable and perfect for when you are dragging back from Marquee nightclub just downstairs at 5 in the morning! The bathroom is what wins it all! The double sink is a required feature for my crew when traveling, but the deep tup with windows facing the Bellagio fountains and mountains was absolutely AMAZING! I recommend a morning bubble bath with a mimosa from the chandelier bar. The terrace is huge and also has a nice seating arrangement set up perfect for smokers and also offers a breathtaking view! \n\nCheck out was a bit of a mess: I used a prepaid debit card, and my room had over used the authorized amount, no biggie. On my way in from the night club I stopped in at check in to switch cards and the woman either didn't listen or didn't know the right answer and I was told that I didn't  need to put up a different card until I was ready to check out. She asked if I was ready and I said no, we still are going to charge breakfast and a couple drinks since we don't leave for awhile. Her response was thats fine just pay the remaining balance at check out, no problem. I get back to my room and my phone is saying I have a message, I call in and she says \" that i have. A balance and need to put up my card, I tell her I was just downstairs and repeated what I was told, and she says ok.  I charge breakfast and a couple drinks to the room with no issue but when I try to go eat at the buffet its an issue.

I have tried three dishes here, and they all have been spectacular. \n\n1. Tallarines Verdes- Breaded steak and pesto spaghetti sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  I am not sure this is considered Peruvian, since my Italian grandparents used to make this dish. However, the pasta is cooked perfectly and the meat is seasoned to perfection. No salt needed! \n2. Loma Saltado- Tender beef strips saut\u00e9ed with tomatoes, onions, and French fries -served over steamed rice.  Oh man, this dish is so tasty. The meat is not fatty, tender, and melts in your mouth. The sauce this dish comes with complements each flavor and soaks in to the delicious pile of rice.  This dish is a must try!\n3. Seco de carne- Beef stewed in cilantro and Peruvian spices, rice, potatoes, peas, and carrots. If I could have one meal for the rest of my life -this would be it.  The beef is slow cooked and falls apart with your fork. I almost passed out when I tried this dish. Food can't possibly this good- can it? Yes! \n\nWhat I like most about his restaurant, is that it doesn't know how good it is. In other words, they are continually trying to improve on perfection with their meals. They are not cutting corners!  The qualities of meat they use are top notch, and the portions are substantial. Prices are moderate, as you can expect to pay 15-20 per entr\u00e9e.  The place also does well as a takeout option. Last time I got food to go, it was still piping hot when I got home (15 minutes later). \n\nI love it here, and wish everyone in Las Vegas would give this place a try.

Many thanks to Yelp for helping me to discover this gem. I arranged a group meal for my old college buddies during our recent trip to Las Vegas. I explained this to the woman I made the reservation with (who inquired if this was a special occasion). Upon arrival, we were greeted at our table by the manager who welcomed and thanked us for choosing his restaurant for our college reunion. I must say that this was a very nice personal gesture, and demonstrates an emphasis on a great customer experience. The space is a more modern take on the traditional steakhouse. I've been in many with the traditional dark wood decor and old time character. That's always nice and fun, but Echo & Rig is one of those foodie-centric establishments which understands that sometimes it's best not to have anything to distract one's attention from the meat (like too much decor). The space was clean, elegant, and minimalist. Perhaps it could be called a new take on an old-school steakhouse. I knew it would be outstanding the second I walked in. Just behind the entrance is a butcher counter with a refrigerated case filled with an incredible array of carnivorous pleasures in the form of cured meats and Charcuterie. I'd say that any steakhouse which is also a butcher shop is almost guaranteed to be great. The service was constant, attentive, and well orchestrated (this despite my rowdy compadres). We ordered a wide assortment of their small plates for openers. Each was better than the next. My personal favorites were the Asparagus & Fried Egg and the Bone Marrow Carne Asada. Please note that this is not totally la-la-carte. Each steak is served with a stuffed mushroom cap and their home made potato chips (all delicious). For my entree I chose their \"Spencer Steak.\" This was the center eye of a Rib Eye (I'm usually not a Rib Eye kind of guy, but this was absolute perfection in a steak)! There is of course an excellent wine list, and a great selection of mixed drinks to accompany a fine meal. Like me, all seven of my friends were completely thrilled with their meals. Another thrill was when the check arrived. Let's just say that we ate a lot of food. In my opinion, the $$ out of a possible $$$$ for the Yelp price review was right on the money (if you'll pardon the pun). One could easily spend twice as much at almost any other steakhouse in Las Vegas, and probably no be as satisfied as we were. Echo & Rig is located just a few miles away from the main strip. It was nice to get away from the craziness of Las Vegas Boulevard for a while, and was well worth the trip. The folks there go the extra mile for their guests, and the results show.

I'd come back to vegas just to eat here.\n\nI hear that SW Steakhouse is a close competition to Del Frisco (which I have not experienced).. but the members of our group who have been to both preferred SW over DF.\n\nWe had reservations for our group of 7 and were seated near to but not next to the great Lake of Dreams (which is both pretty trippy and cool.. gorgeous view tho!)  Started off with a couple of bottles of wine and THE BEST BACON BREAD EVER.  It was hard for the girls not to scarf and fill up on this bread.  The cream butter with two types of fancy smancy sea salt was soo good.  Soft, creamy, and melt in your fattty mouth heaven.  I adore bread.  Both the french and the bacon bread were delicious.  (Take a gander which one was better)..\n\nSome of the members had appetizers.. and the BLT salad came with this FAT solid 1 inch slice of premium bacon.. balancing atop crisp lettuce and heirloom tomatoes.  It was a gorgeous sight.  I can only dream of how big this slab of bacon was before being cooked down.\n\nOur meal was absolutely delicious.  \n\nBF and I split the Porter for two (I did the math and it was cheaper than the individual steaks).  IT WAS DIVINE.  Came out sizzling and hot in a huge plate (it was a shit load of meat for two people~ i think like 40 ozs?  I know~ fat@ss. haha).  We added the fois gras - which was an awesome move cuz it made everything melt in your mouth.  There was a side of.. not leeks.. but similar to celery root .. just can't remember.. but it was all heavenly.\n\nWe got sides to split for the table... and YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY GET THE CREAMED CORN.  I don't normally enjoy creamed veggies but this was ... sex rolled into a winning lotto ticket and a double promotion at work.  Yes.  It was awesome.  The mac and cheese was meh~ not bad but a little bland.. and... I can't remember the other sides but they were all fabulous.  TRUFFLED CREAM CORN. GET IT.\n\nService was great.  Wine and food abundant.  Great friends.\nIt was by far the best experience second to Chippendales.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place and would absolutely return (once I save up enough money haha).

Forget Red Lobster, if you want quality seafood and you are not by the ocean, this is THE place. One this occasion I wanted crabs (duh) and muscles. So what did I order? A steampot naturally! This pot contained legs, scallops, muscles, and the standard corn and potatoes.  As is tradition, I asked for a side of Old Bay and a bottle of malt vinegar to create my own paste, which I greedily dunk the meat in. The server, Nicole, was very patient as I requested these things and when I asked for Sweet N Low for my iced tea, I wasn't upset when she explained that they didn't carry it. \n\nI got a side of hushpuppies to accompany my feast and was not disappointed in the least. I believe I may have converted Darren when he tried one after he told me he didn't like hushpuppies. \n\nGrowing up close to the Chesapeake Bay area, I have perfected the art of picking crabs and managed to get all of the meat out of almost every leg segment in whole. Darren loves watching me at work, never using a fork, and rarely using the nut crackers, or what they call crab crackers. These scallops were the best I have ever had! Seared on only one side and deliciously soft and juicy on the inside. The muscles were also amazing! I was saddened that I didn't have an endless plate of scallops and muscles. I have to say that I did have a pleasant surprise. When I was finished I looked under the plate that was in the pot and noticed an extra scallop and extra muscle! It felt like getting a small bonus!  \n\nI got the chocolate cake for dessert. It was huge!

The soup was well done and flavourful, really enjoyed it.\n   + Their side dishes were very good and unique. I would say they have the best side dishes aside from Tofu village I have ever tried.\n- Portion: Generous, you only need to order one dish to be completely full.\n- Price: Ridiculously cheap compare to other Korean restaurant in K town, like $7 for a huge bowl of pork bone soup that I couldn't even finish it. \n- Place is small, if you go during lunch or dinner hours, you need to wait for about 15-30mins.\n- Service was fast and good.\n- Highly highly recommend this place if you want to try cheap and authentic Korean food.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Curt, Jerry and everyone else at Jay's are fantastic.

Being that NTK had made the top 25 restaurants in the burgh, i had to try it. So we made a rez and headed over.\n\nLet's start by saying it is in an interesting neighborhood.  They are rehabbing lots of houses so there is some other activity on the street.  But it is a teenie tiny little house converted to a restaurant.\n\nWhen you enter, you will look at those front steps and think \"it's not too late to turn around\" - but ignore the cracked steps and keep going.\n\nThen you enter the house and walk down a long hallway when you think \"i should have turned around at the steps\" but keep walking.\n\nWhen they seat you, you immediately realize that you are in a tiny little dining room and it is rather cozy.\n\nAnd then - the menu comes.  Wow. Just wow.  Yeah, they have pad thai. and they have curry. and they have rad na noodles. and then they have lots of other choices - vegetarian, thai-hesitant (for those who don't like thai or are fearful of thai), and just some really really cool dishes.\n\nSo here goes the rundown of what was ordered.\n\nThe appetizer dog choice was the fresh spring rolls. So how do you differentiate yourself from the competition?  Slice them into manageable chunks so that they can be shared easily and dipped into that Yummy  dipping sauce.\n\nI start with me as I can't rave enough about what I had.  Phar Luck Chicken.  it was a plate of steamed veggies (gr beans, snow peas, broccoli) covered with rice noodles, chicken breasts that were lightly spiced, then a peanut sauce on top.  I ordered a level 5 not knowing how it would be as one restaurant's 5 is another one's 3or 7.  Veggies were nicely steamed and crisp.  The chicken was mildly spiced atop a bed of noodles. And finished with a medium spiced peanut sauce. Just enough to taste but not over soaked.  And the surprise?  Two shrimps and some lump crabmeat.\n\nOk chef - one comment here. I loved the seafood but I know not everyone can eat that so including something that can trigger an allergic reaction without disclosing it can lead to disaster. And no customer would ever assume to ask about shrimp in a chicken dish.  Maybe add it to the description or have waitstaff mention it when it is ordered?\n\nDH had green curry with chicken.  Lots of veggies, nicely spiced but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was good but maybe not as strong of a curry taste as he was used to.  But it held its own with the other Thai restaurants.\n\nDSS had crab pineapple fried rice.  Ok. Seriously. How could you not love that combo. It took self-restraint on my part to not just grab that plate from him. Now THAT was an unusual combo I have never seen elsewhere and according to DSS, it was great (first sign of a good dish?  No offers to share :)\n\nOur server was excellent.  Never was a water glass empty.  plates were removed promptly. We were never rushed as we lingered in conversation.  \n\nSo this is now added to my \"places to visit when back in the burgh\" list.\n\n\n7/16. Update.\nI decided while back in the burgh again on business to revisit NTK.  I ordered takeout to nibble back at the hotel.  A few comments. \n1.  The Phar Luck was as good as I remembered.  Yum again\n2.  I passed on an appetizer so I could Try their sticky rice with custard.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered black sticky rice....oh my....wow.  Topped with a square of creamy smooth custard topped with coconut.  Again the little details that make NTK just stand out from the pack.\n3.  I was surprised to be charged a surcharge for a takeout order.  Seriously? Each item was marked up for the privilege of saving them the salary they pay their waitstaff when I took the food out. No, it is not a big deal (a little over 10% or so). Again, disclosure would have been nice. Or no surcharge at all.\n4.  Speaking of takeout, chef, how about using some of that surcharge to pay for decent plastic ware? I don't do chopsticks and found that it was impossible to spear the steamed veggies with those dollar store forks. Since I was in a hotel without a kitchen, that was the only fork I had and when it snapped in the broccoli....well....let's just say it wasn't pretty.  So maybe think about some decent flatware, so I don't need to pack my own next time I get takeout?", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Love this fun, friendly place.

There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, but we still got to our table quickly and our servers were very patient and friendly as we waited for the rest of our group to get there. One of them offered us some recommendations on the drink menu, and educated us about some of the food items we would be offered as well.\nOnce everyone arrived, we walked over to the salad bar which had a ton of great options! There were many different vegetables, soups, salads, and other sides. Among the options, some of the things I chose were lobster bisque, asparagus, mushroom salad, roasted peppers, shrimp, smoked salmon, quinoa and squash. I got very small samples of the sides, knowing that there was still a lot of food to come. After we sat back down at the table, we were told to flip our cards over to green whenever we were ready for the different meats. Once you do that, there is a parade of large skewers being brought around by various servers that have some of the best steak, chicken, and pork that you'll ever find in one place! I had bacon wrapped filet, top sirloin, tenderloin, and garlic steak. Every single one was so flavorful and tender. What I also love, is that they bring different steak temperatures around and ask you if you'd like that, or let you know that they'll be bringing around one that is your preferred temperature soon. If they only have something in medium rare, for example, you can also request that it be cooked longer. There were some of the meats that we really enjoyed at our table, and when we asked for extra slices or larger portions, our server did not hold back! He was very generous and happy to come back frequently to bring anything we needed. We got so much food, and it was definitely worth the price!

I love the paintings and mirrors that are hang on the walls. When we first walked in, we were greed by a very friendly waitress. We started out by ordering Thai iced tea and egg rolls as an appetizer.  Their tea has the perfect portion of milk, tea and sweetness. I would have ordered another one if I had more room in my stomach. Egg rolls are very crispy, non-greasy and it goes very well with the sweet sauce that it was served with.

They offered generous portion of beef for my drunken noodles and it was so delicious. For dessert, we ordered Mango with sticky rice.

Let this place transport you to a different world as it abducts you to a nightclub scene that's out of this world. From the moving LED chandelier that almost resembles a spaceship, posh decor, and relatively easy to navigate layout (especially in comparison to its sister club Hakkansan...), I was definitely impressed by what this can offer to the always growing nightlife of Vegas.\n\nThey do have guestlist so feel free to check with your promoters, but I'd still recommend just buying the presale ticket so you can take your time and not have to rush to get there around 9-10. With a ticket, you can pre-party all you want and enter in at around 11-midnight without any problem. That money you save by getting in with guestlist will just be used up when you need to get your drinks on in the club so it really cancels out in the end!\n\nIf you're ballin' hard enough, each table gets an amazing view of the main room. They definitely designed this place to make sure everyone got an unobstructed view of the morphing chandelier! Luckily, I got to get a good view at a table RIGHT behind the DJ. Martin Garrix definitely lived up to his hype!\n\nThe Hip-hop room also gets preeeetty packed, but the crowd is definitely poppin. If you want some space or breathing room, definitely venture upstairs to the balcony terrace area where you get an even closer view of the spaceship... er I mean chandelier!

It's so awesome that a place like this exist right outside of downtown Pittsburgh. I've been looking at this place on social media for quite the time now. I've finally had a chance to come and I'm so beyond stoked I did. On entering I was greeted by the front desk and helped since it was my first time here. You feel out a waver give your id snap a picture for the system and that's pretty much it. I brought my own bike and helmet so it was only around $21 bucks for all day. My buddy didn't have a bike or a helmet so $21 for getting in, $15 for a rental bike, $5 for a helmet. I can't really say anything negative about that or pricing because most people have there own gear plus the prices are super reasonable. I couldn't believe some of the bike they rented out and how nice there where. My buddy got a specialized dirt jumper p3 with upgraded rims. That's like a $1400 bike with $1k rims for $15 bucks! This place is massive and one thing I wanna say is they have a community work bike station for any small repairs. I had to throw some air in my tires and adjust my breaks and it really helped out a lot. Now as far as riding goes this park really does offer stuff for everyone from beginner to advanced lines. I spent a easy 5 plus hours here my first time and still was not board. I can't decide on a favorite part of the park yet but the foam pit is a blast! They do offer a changing room as well as a rest area to eat or drink. You can't have drinks on the floor being it's wood and don't want any one to get hurt. But they do offer a little shop area for drinks or candy bars or chips as well as parts. One thing I can say that disappointed me was they have signs everywhere that they ride with turners tea but there was no turners tea to be found anywhere.

To get there you need to go west of 5th Elementt, north on Ryerson Avenue, right on Wolseley and right again (one way street). \n\nThe ambiance was enjoyable. Not pretentiously over-classy, but adequately so. We were sat at one of the booths and the waiter was very well-mannered and respectful. He had a very professional attitude and took our orders patiently. \n\nI could tell that the entrepreneurs of this restaurant were an innovative bunch as they had a small promotional sign on the table: \"Leave your business cards for a chance to win a dinner for 2!

Tolerably spicy for those with sensitive tongues (like me), but considered mild for the chili-lovers. Although I liked the, my mother was iffy with the samosas, saying they were not crispy enough, but blaming it on her own taste preferences. The portions were decent and we were starting to feel our stomachs occupied.\n\nAfter another 15 minutes or so since the waiter had taken our appetizer dishes away, the entrees came. The portions were deceivingly small and the sauce on my butter chicken looked generous, but I was very full by the end of it! The portions and sauce-chicken-rice ratio were actually quite accurate. The sauce was delicious and well-mastered, and the chicken was tender. The rice was yellow with tamarik and spices. It was one of the best meals I'd had. \n\nThe desserts however were not really my cup of tea. I ordered the Gulab Jamun after googling pictures of it. They were like 2 little timbits on my plate, awkwardly spread apart on polar ends of my dish. it was coconut-y and very, very sweet. Although small, it was dense with syrup.\nThe rice pudding was bland by comparison, quite watery, and the carrot halwa was in between. \n\nThe meal, all in all, was wonderful, especially for the price offered ($9.95 for 3 courses!)

With classes scheduled on Mon, Weds, Fri, & Sat, Team Beaurgard makes it real hard to come up with an excuse to skip jiu jitsu. Still can't make it, Ryan and his instructors offer private lessons. \n\nSo.. Why do I think Ryan is the best instructor in Phoenix? I have trained jiu jitsu for years before coming to Ryan. I had some difficulties in jiu jitsu given my unique body type. I decided this wasn't for me and tried other activities to attempt to stay in shape. I belong to a gym and even tried cross-fit. 14 months later I came to him 25# overweight and couldn't last 3 minutes on the mat due to my lack of cardio. 6 months later, I am the IBBJF Blue belt National Champion and down almost 30#. Being a prior service Marine, I can say that training jiu jitsu allows me to stay in the best shape of my life. \n\nFor anyone even remotely interested in jiu jitsu, grappling, or just fitness (staying in shape) training jiu jitsu is the best workout you will EVER get. If you want the best instructor in Phoenix, contact Ryan Beauregard.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Great Greek restaurant! The food is delicious.

After going here for most of a year, I'm a totally happy customer and still love this place!  Joe is my regular barber now, but when he's not around any of the other barbers do a great job too.  And Denise usually cuts my son's hair.  Never a complaint!  Read on to see my original review:\n\nA real barber shop!  That's where I told my son I was taking him when we went to Figaro's for a haircut several weeks ago.  I went once, took him on my second visit, and just enjoyed my third visit there yesterday.  Time for a review!\n\nThe barbers are very friendly, professional, take their time and have a great amount of experience.  And the place looks and feels like a barber shop ought to.  Everything on the walls is interesting, the music is never too loud, and you can even get a shoe shine.  What I think I love most besides a great haircut, is the shop isn't based on a particular gimmick or theme to try and draw in business.  Figaro's is a quality barber shop, knows it, and stands solidly on that fact.  As a result, they don't hurt for business.  By the way, mornings, lunch time, and late afternoons can be busy, but things are fairly quiet in the late mornings and early afternoons.  Keep that in mind if you're on a schedule and intend to just drop in.\n\nI've taken the first available barber on each of my three visits and all three haircuts were great.  At some point I'll settle on a particular barber, but for now I'm still enjoying meeting each of them.\n\nThe price is right:  $17 for a regular haircut, which includes cleaning up around your ears and neck with hot lather and a blade, a hot towel, and some tonic to cool things off.  As with other good barber shops, there are additional charges for a shave, beard trim, custom cuts, etc.  You can see all the pricing online, or posted clearly on the wall in the shop.\n\nFigaro's is located in a storefront.  In's easy to find and there's always lots of parking.  Next time you or your kiddo needs a haircut, I highly recommend giving Figaro's a try.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "In a nutshell, Scott McWilliams was able to easily explain my rights as a tenant.

As of this review, I have received written confirmation from my landlord that my problem will be rectified by Friday, April 10th.

We live in the neighbourhood and had long wondered what would become of the previously vacant commercial space. We were pleasantly surprised and very pleased to discover it had been utterly transformed. This could easily be a new favourite spot - we really can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! \n\nThe positives: \n\n-Courteous, knowledgeable staff, they're attentive without hovering. Our server introduced various items on the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences. She also took the time to explain the source and cultural aspects of dishes. The restaurant was packed by the time we were halfway through our meal, but the glasses of water were never less than half full at our table (different servers would top it up, depending on whoever spotted it) and they would discreetly and efficiently tidy up the table in between courses as needed. This little bit of extra attention to detail is what we'd expect from a fine dining restaurant but the overall ambiance was relaxed elegance, welcoming and not pretentious at all. The staff really worked well as a team and it was impressive. \n\n-The FOOD! \n\nWe started with the daily special seafood ceviche (I'm crossing my fingers in hopes that this gets added to the permanent menu - it's delicious!) and the trio of dips (aguacate, chicatana, papanteca) which come with tostadas. They were all quite flavourful and not overly spicy, if anything we could stand for the papanteca to be spicier. \n\nThe tlacoyo was up next and beautifully presented. Flavours and textures were well balanced, definitely something I'd order again. \n\nOur veggie and meat choices were the camote a pas brasas and chorizo toluque\u00f1o, respectively. I enjoyed the chorizo but absolutely loved the sweet potato dish. Wish I knew how to make it at home! But it's probably a good thing that I don't lol \n\nWe were about to opt out of dessert, considering that we were already fairly full. Luckily one of the servers stopped by to describe what the three options were in more detail and we decided to try the xocolatl. It definitely didn't disappoint, if anything, now that we know what it is we'd be disappointed if we DIDN'T end the meal off by sharing that excellent dark chocolate ice cream with goat's milk caramel and sea salt drizzle, pear pearls and a praline of sorts. It was perfectly portioned for sharing to end off a memorable meal. \n\nWe will also definitely be back to try the tasting menu sometime. For curious would-be diners, they had ball parked it at $75 per person. \n\n-Interior Design - The restaurant layout was definitely crafted to showcase the bar, food, and unique atmosphere. It's stylish without sacrificing functionality, elegant without feeling formal, and most definitely a welcoming spot to enjoy a fantastic meal. \n\nThey are certainly a \"pricier\" dining option for the neighbourhood, but given the quality of the food and service, the cost is not only fair but also well worth it.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "All of the meat is really delicious including the spicy sausage, thick cut bacon, and pulled pork.

Very good as well with nice bright orange flavor.\n\nWill have to try to make my own creation next time and be adventurous.\n\nThe price is about $2 after tax for each a little pricey for the size of donut but they are made to order so not too bad.\n\nQuick addition:\n\nStopped by to try two more donuts this time custom style:\n\n-Key lime/ Sea salt -Bright green, Sweet tangy and tasty\n-Maple/ Bacon -Perfect breakfast Donut, slightly sweet and savory salty with the bacon pieces\n\nRating still holds, great place for warm hot gooey goodness", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "The food was fresh and very good.

The dandelion muse was so interesting! It was probably my favorite part of the dish aside from the sweet bread, of course. Everything was so light and it all blended so well. I'm a huge mule fan and the New England mule was nothing short of delicious. \n\nFor the second course I had the Spinach Ricotta Gnudi with rapini pesto, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed cherry tomatoes, golden raisins, pine nuts, balsamic glaze and seasonal wild mushroom. I'm gonna go ahead and say that I am a huge mushroom hater but on this night I set aside our differences and actually ENJOYED them greatly in this dish. And oh my god, can we talk about the br\u00fbl\u00e9ed cherry tomatoes?! I want a lifetime supply of these!! This dish was paired with a Hemingway Daiquiri which I thought was super appropriate. Hemingway said these drinks \"had no taste of alcohol and felt, as you drank them, the way downhill glacier skiing feels running through powder snow.\" And yeah, I couldn't agree more. He would've been proud of both the dish and his namesake drink. \n\nFor my third and final course I had the Veal Chop with melted fennel bulb, tomato mustard relish, confit tomato and creme fraiche bound farro. Okay so I'm going to rant and rave about how absolutely PERFECT the veal was. It was seriously cooked so perfectly! I could have ordered seconds or thirds. Probably even fourths. Actually I would have made all three of my courses this dish. I could have wiped that kitchen out of this dish if allowed to. It was absolutely AMAZING.

I say generous because 80% of their menu is under $10, with only 1 or 2 items even breaking past $15. So, needless to say, this place was cheap.\n\nI purchased the $12 chicken and ribs platter. You get a chicken breast and wing along with 1/3 a rack of ribs (or a \"rib tickler\" as I believe they call it). You also get a large portion of fries, 2 sugar biscuits, and the choice of an additional side. I order the baked beans. My friend purchased the $8 or $9 steak sandwich, which came with the choice of a side (she ordered fries) and whatever toppings you wanted on the sandwich.\n\nThe amount of food for the price was absolutely incredible. My platter was literally served on a platter and was only $12. The chicken was a small piece, but the breast was surprisingly meaty. It was very tender and juicy and covered in their delicious BBQ. The ribs were a little bit on the dry side. They were certainly not falling off the bone and they required a little extra BBQ, but they were by no means bad. Again, for the price, they were awesome. The baked beans were very very tasty. They were made with their BBQ and almost had a sweet chili taste to them. I'm not normally a baked beans fan, but I devoured these. The french fries were french fries, but in a massive portion... They were basically a restaurant version of McDonald's fries, which is not a bad thing. The sugar biscuits were the same thing that you find at Chinese buffets, but they were much fresher then you'd find at any buffet. \n\nAll together, I was very pleased with Sauceman's. They serve cheaper restaurant quality food, but in a Cook Out or Penguin style setting. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you at your seat. You refill your drinks yourself and when you are done, they clear your table for you.

Being a smaller place makes it more economical to run and I like the more intimate environment.\n\nLet's cover the food shall we?\n\nHunan Dumplings 5/5\nAbsolutely delicious! The sauce/dumplings really are orgasmic. Why can't I find other types of dumplings that I like this much? The highlight of the evening for me.

The sauce is just right and this sets off the evening in thr right direction with this tasty treat.\n\nSesame Beef 5/5\nPossibly the best Sesame Beef found anywhere in the GMA. They are somewhat crunchy with a tangy flavor, but when you bite into them the flavor just melts in your mouth. It's quite therapeutic.\n\nGarlic Beef Noodles 5/5\nA plate of dry noodles gets invaded by another plate of warm beef drenched in a succulent garlic sauce which makes the dry noodles lose their dryness and get infused by a sauce made by an incredible chef. Why am I drooling?\n\nOrange Beef 4/5\nI always enjoyed orange beef, the sauce us tangy and makes it a suitable change to your taste-buds with most plates being sweet.\n\nGeneral Tao 2/5\nUsually a main event plate but for some reason the sauce tonight was off, far too tangy and it didn't taste right. I'll need to order this again on my next visit and see if this is a permanent change to their sauce or something that will never happen again.

The real gem here though is Chef Mike Smith. He is as affable as he is talented. He makes it a point to come out of the kitchen and talk and greet his guests. \n\nThe place is BYOB, which is fine, though the corking fee seems a bit excessive.

When I found out that he was opening up just down the street from my place, I knew I had to check it out. \n\nThe Resurva booking system is fantastic because I can easily see exactly what times are available, as well as having the ability to cancel and reschedule within seconds. The barbershop is typical old school which in reality is quite charming. There is no pretentious design or stuck up feeling here. The best part is often coming through the door and chatting with Brian and his current client as you wait for your turn. The conversations are always quite interesting and even for someone in their very early twenties, I always love spending 30-45 mins at the barbershop chatting as Brian does his work.\n\nThe haircuts are absolutely unbelievable. The cuts go way beyond anything you have ever experienced and his attention to detail is remarkable. Brian had posted on Instagram a few months ago that his goal is to ensure that the haircut looks just as good grown in (in two weeks), as it does when it's fresh.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it's Brian who makes the shop what it is. I've yet to meet someone so humble and he goes above and beyond for his clients. I had asked him if people tend to shave in their part after a week or so once it grows in. Brian told me not to bother, and to just come in whenever I needed the part to be re-shaved in. I've asked barbers in the past for something small like that, and most will say they are too busy, etc. \n\nBrian is one of the best in Toronto and if you truly appreciate a fine hair cut and service that goes above and beyond, I'd suggest you give him a shot. All you should do is take a look at the Nite Owl's Instagram and look at the incredible work he does.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Matrix reference:\nPicture Neo and Trinity in a white room.

I loved my evening here from the overwhelming beer menu to their fantastic food! \n\nWe were warned before ordering our dinner that it would take sometime as the kitchen was pretty busy, but the wait between our drinks arriving and the waitress coming back to get our food order seemed longer than the actual food prep time. It didn't really matter as we were not in a particular rush, (if we were, this might have been a 4 star review). But you could spend ages going through the beer menu (and the chalk board) with what you would like to sample, from $8 - $9 650ml bottles to $40 and over! I would never order a bottle for the price of over $15 or $20, but the higher prices does make me curious! \n\nIt was a shame that a lot of their bottles were out of stock so I went with the waiter's recommendation of \"Tipperary\" a pale ale full of flavour! \nI recommend letting the staff know what type of beer you do enjoy and they will definitely recommend something that's right up your alley. \n\nEverything in the short menu seems simple, but you just get a feeling that they would make it so everything clicks and you end up with a tassty Italian dish! I got the \"volo burger\" and for $16 it was very nicely done, not an overdose of food like you would get at more mainstream joints. We ordered a cheese plate as well and I definitely recommend it for a great sharing start! I almost forgot the dessert too!

Pies are generally large in size, but moreso cardboard thin. Perfect proportions of Italian GRAVY (thicker sauce, still slightly marina based), cheese, and Italian spices. Pies have very crisp dough & crust, and not saturated by a lot of moisture, as you would find at your local Papa John's or Pizza Hut. Pies are generally cooked at very high temperatures, for a very short time- i.e. 800+ degrees for under 10mins.\n\nThat said, this restaurant makes their pies accordingly. Word of advice, if you have an appetite, try to avoid having eyes bigger than your stomach here. Their medium pie is a large at any other pizza joint, and their large is, accordingly, an extra-large. All kidding aside, the large will feed quite a few easily, with leftovers. In addition to their pie sizes, they mimic the above NY-style well. I don' know whether or not they incorporate dough conditioners or MSG's but their pizza is incredibly tasty!\n\nTheir overall menu is more of a combination between Italian and finger food. You won't find many lavish pasta entrees, but you can get yourself a philly cheesesteak and some jalopeno poppers. \n\nLocated in the Davis Lake Commons.

I had the 22 oz Bone Morrow Ribeye and I requested a blue cheese crust which was not on the menu but after our server spoke to the chef they were able to accommodate the request. This was the best steak I've ever had, the bone Morrow was as amazing as everyone says, paired with a nice glass of wine and the amazing views this is an all time favorite of ours. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an amazing overall dining experience.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Tried this place out for the first time and it was a breeze. Drove in, parked and within 2 minutes the van came to me to pick me up. It was a quick drive to my terminal. The gentleman was super friendly. \n\nWhen I arrived I was a bit confused where to go. On the FAQ page they say to go to the courtesy and prearranged vehicle spot on the north curb. Well in terminal 4 those are two very different places. Quickly realized that the prearranged vehicle spot was not the right spot as I saw one of the vans fly by me :). A quick walk down to the courtesy shuttle area and right away there was somebody there to pick me up. Again another friendly guy who drove me right to my car. \n\nWill use these guys again!", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "We stumbled upon this place wandering around mile end. This place is amazing. If I could give it six stars I would. Service is amazing. The food is amazing. The man behind the counter gave us local tips for other places to eat. Wow could not ask for a better experience!!!!", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Corbin came to the rescue for us.  We had an order that was extremely delayed by an inefficient person at a different vendor.  If we had left it up to the inefficient person, we would have had the cabinets in and no counter  for almost 2 months.  Contacted Corbin on 10/17...late in the day.  He came to measure on 10/20 and  installed it on 10/27. Boom, boom.boom!!!!  DONE!   His workmanship is amazing and he was an absolute gem to work with.  Cannot give him enough praise for coming through when we were so frustrated with our other vendor.", "stars": 5.0}]
