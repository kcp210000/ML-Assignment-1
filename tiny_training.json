[{"text": "Terrible service and frozen-dim-sum-like quality food!  \n\nService:\nEven for Chinatown standards this place's service is bad! Carts couldn't get to us (which is fine b/c we were seated in a bad location and it was a busy afternoon).  In such a case ladies would make a decent effort to ask if you wanted anything or the waitresses would take your order and get us food.  Here, no one asked us and the waitress refused to take our order saying that's not her job.  \n\nThen when we finally got food at our table the same waitress moved a dish off the table towards my friend while she had her chopstick in the steamer saying to get out of her way while she cleared out table.  At this point I lost it and told her off and asked for the manager.  The manager finally came and I gave her a ear full and then some but to no avail. \n\nFood:\nIf service bad and food is ok then that's ok, but if service and food are bad then hell-to-the-no-way!!!!  The dim sum tasted like the frozen ones you get from the supermarket.  We ordered the usual fair and one of the dishes that came was RANCID (I kid you not).  Finally I saw the worst possible thing, they recycle the sauces.  We ordered fried shrimp dumplings that had mayo for dipping sauce.  We had a lot left over and when they cleared the plate I saw the lady recycle our mayo back onto another plate - disgusting or what?  \n\nBottom Line:\nDon't go unless you want to pay for people to treat you bad and overpay for frozen dim sum.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Stopped in for a quick lunch and was very disappointed.The bartender was friendly and the service was great but the food was bad.The chips were stale and the salsa looked like wet dog food and it tasted worse than it looked.The tacos really had no taste.As I sat there after I ordered my food and tried to eat it I thought what a mistake coming here.I don't like to put negative feedback out but it was so bad it was a must.I was also told a new owner took over a few months ago and I'm not sure that's correct but either way I will never go back even if the food was free.This place didn't seem very clean either, as I sat at the bar to eat my shirt sleeves stuck to the bar a few times as I reached for my drink or food.I feel bad for the bartender cause he seemed to be a nice guy and he can't be doin very well with the product the owners put out.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Very rude attitude.

Actually, that's not it - the lamb isn't the most tender for the way it's cooked and barely tastes like lamb - if I was in China, I would think that this was fake lamb meat. For much less, I had better lamb at Jerk King... If you are in the area, do yourself a favour and take your money to \"Under The Table\" - where the wait staff are amazing and the food is great and cheap, the oxtail and I bet everything else there is way better and about 2/3rds the price of this place.\n\nThe Mexican rice (which they said would be purple rice... was not purple). It's the same on in the Barbacoa, which the rice was ok - it was a bit mushy though.\n\nOverall, don't send your Foodora driver/cyclist there and make them feel like s**t about themselves because of the pretentiousness here.

Furthering the vegan experience she asked for the chef to come up with something special which came in the form of a bean burrito, a bean enchilada and a plop of beans as a side dish...just in case.

Let's start with prior to my stay. I booked 5 rooms for 2 nights. (Mon-weds) I called a few times to get things in order apparently the automated message let's you know they are experiencing high call volumes  (probably people calling to complain) I waited on hold 10minutes.  I was calling to request the rooms I booked be on the same floor, and prices to upgrade room as well as a question about a show. Well, crappy customer service the guy had a attitude an without notice transferred me elsewhere for the show an didn't even answer my other questions so I had to call back an wait on hold again ! Ok well a week later it's check in time out of all the times I called not 1 person put a note in the computer. So my check in took 40 minutes  they are definitely under staffed. We got one of the suites it was ok had a crappy view of nothing out the window and hot water wasn't working in our 2nd bathroom and shower head sucked and extremely small t.vs. Also their pool has been out of service for months and will continue to be so that's a HUGE inconvenience they make u walk to mgm or Mandalay Bay which r both far walks then u have ro walk through the whole place to the back to the pool then you get there an are told 2 people per room key and we had 3 people an 1 key we didn't need  2 keys since we were all sticking around eachother. Would of been nice of Monte Carlo to let guests know that!!! Also didn't know until check in that on the high floors our water would be turned off from 12-6 or 7!!!! It was also nice to have someone else's food carts (3 of them) in front of our door all 3 days we were there!!! Oh not to mention our room keys to 2 of our rooms stopped working out of no where so we had to walk down to the front an wait in their lovely long SLOW line again to get new keys which made us late to where we were going. Also we noticed when walking through the hotel some parts smelt like sewer or something real bad. Walls are paper thin so be prepared to hear vacuuming and people's toilets. Ahh let's not forget the construction who started bright and early every day and the boss man down there screaming at his crew. That was nice.

Horrible service zero acknowledgement.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Wow, if only someone would have warned us about the severe sketchiness of this place 3 years ago, we could have saved ourselves thousands of dollars and countless headaches.  \n\nFirst, the property isn't as glamorous as the photos they had professionally taken show, this place looks nothing like that.  It's constantly covered in leaves and bird poop.  The parking spots are all slanted forward and when it rains the completely overflow with water, since the drainage pipes are all clogged.  It will literally stay a giant pond of water for weeks until the water finally evaporates.  We complained about this many times over the years, but they claimed it couldn't be fixed.  Talk about a giant mosquito breeding zone.  \n\nThe \"gated community\" they like to brag about is a complete joke.  The drive up gates are broken AT LEAST 2 weeks out of the month and just remain stuck open.  So whats the point?  The gates all around the community perimeter are either welded shut, or broken so anyone can come in or out.  They claimed they were all fixed, but we used them often and they never did get fixed.  \n\nThe hottub is the biggest joke ever.  It never works.  And when I say never, I mean NEVER works.  I would be generous in saying that it works 1 week out of the month before its \"down for repairs\" again.  They try to put band aid fixes on everything, instead of just putting in quality work, especially seeing how much they charge! The pools are ok.  Always dirty and full of leaves and doesn't feel very heated in the winter like they claim.  \n\nMaintenance is another joke.  We turned in countless repair requests that would go completely unanswered for weeks unless we called to complain about it.  One time they even marked that they did the work, when they never even stopped by.  The two guys are shady and we didn't trust them inside our apartments without us there to watch their every move.  \n\nBBQs are all crap.  They are missing knobs and half the time don't even turn on.  The first year we lived here they were even chained shut so people couldn't use them.  Now they are just empty and don't work.  \n\nDon't move here if you have a pet and don't want to pay a FORTUNE.  Pet fee to move in is nonrefundable $300 and that DOESN'T go towards the apartment AT ALL.  ZERO of it will be used to fix anything pet damage related because they call it a FEE and not a DEPOSIT.  I got into with the assistant mgr because he said they say FEE so they don't have to use it for anything but pure profit.  On top of that is $36 PER MONTH pet rent.  So 1 year for 1 pet is $732 (not including tax).  Even after paying this amount, they hardly ever replace their doggy doo station bags.  You have to call them repeatedly to get them to replace it and in the meantime the grounds get covered with dog poo.  It's disgusting.  \n\nFEES.  FEES.  FEES.  To live here, you have to pay pet rent fees, water fees, sewer fees, trash fees, pest control fees (I only saw them come out once), a fee for them to print your bill (and you CAN'T opt out), a fee to pay online, a fee for auto-debit, a $50 fee for a gate opener, and probably others that I can't think of because there are THAT many fees they don't tell you about.  We just got hit with more fees after turning in our move out notice, because they said you have to pay for something from the month you first moved in.  Which for us was 3 years ago.  They couldn't show me where in the contract it showed this, so they were forced to waive them.  The area director even admitted to us that they need to fix it because its a hidden fee not in the lease and people always complain about it.  Rent went up every single year we lived there and when we left it was far more than we are now paying for our house per month.  Basically this is corporate America at its finest.  They will charge you crazy high amounts for everything they can legally get away with and then they will put very little of it back into the property.  But someone somewhere sure is lining their pockets! \n\nMoving out was a disaster.  They did the walk without us being present, even with us demanding to be there.  Then they charged us to replace all the carpets, but wouldn't let us see them or a chance to have them cleaned.  They claimed it was heavy traffic and pet urine damage, but that is complete nonsense.  Basically they have found every loophole in the law and will exploit it to whatever financial gain they can get.  \n\nAt the end of the day, this place isn't worth the amount it costs to live there.  Do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and look elsewhere.  If you do decide to move here, make sure you read that contract from top to bottom and get EVERYTHING in writing.

I had this gripe when I ate at Mandalay's noodle shop a few weeks ago when my lunch special was an astonishing $18 for a soup and lunch-portioned dish.

So I'm in the market to buy a nice new vehicle, my Lexus is 10 years old and I'm ready for a new SUV. Keep in mind - \"I'm\" buying the vehicle for myself not my husband and I. My husband has been accompanying me on the weekends to dealerships over the past couple of months. He brings a newspaper and hunkers down as I discuss vehicles with the different salespeople...truthfully he's really not into cars. At every dealership they approach my husband first and he has to direct them to me and tell salesman he is not buying the car...his wife is. Even then, at some of the dealerships they still try to sell to him while talking to me - probably thinking he has some decision making power over the \"little lady\" or somehow holds the purse strings. I'm now really close to negiotiating a deal on a SUV and decided to make one last dealership visit this evening and this time...god forbid ALL BY MYSELF. CRAZY....a women, at a dealership to buy a luxury vehicle on her own...without her husband or father in tow. So I enter GLENMORE AUDI around 7:00 tonight and there is a man and his daughter looking at the vehicles in the showroom, they are helped by a salesperson, other than them there are no other customers in sight. I'm nicely dressed, I walk around looking at the cars, 5 minutes passes and no salesperson approaches, then 10 minutes and nothing, 15 minutes no assistance is offered. In the meantime, I count at least 5 salespeople who were idle either at their desks or walking around. They all see me including the receptionist and many make eye contact, but to them I'm invisible. Should I have to beg someone to help me if I'm a women looking to buy a nice car on my own? I'm pretty certain if my husband had accompanied me the experience would have been completely different. Why is it in 2016 a successful women cannot enter a luxury car dealership and be taken seriously? After 20 minutes I left feeling humiliated, hurt and angry. To the folks at GLENMORE AUDI, as Julia Roberts said in Pretty Women \"BIG MISTAKE\". We need to all call out this sort of behaviour for things to finally change.

Now I'm not at all familiar with their policies on handling potential merchandise, but I did consider walking in to ask if an employee could help me unload. In the end I decided to do things myself by simply popping the trunk, pulling the box out, and setting it on the curb in front of the store. I then picked up my sleeping son and used my foot to scoot the box to the door. Fun, right?\n\nTo my pleasant surprise, a very helpful gentleman rushed to the door to open it for me. Seeing that my hands were full, he offered to pick up the box and carry it in for me. I happily accepted and profusely thanked him as he set the box on the counter inside. When he turned and wrapped his arm around a lady to walk back to the door, I realized I wasn't being helped by an employee, but by a fellow customer.\n\nUnfortunately, that helpful customer was the highlight of the entire visit.\n\nBoth employees behind the counter (a lady and a gentleman) were busy with customers so I was left waiting. Completely understandable, but it was warm in there and holding another warm body was making things difficult. Eventually the lady was free to help me, and instructed me to open my box to pull out the movies. She wasn't particularly friendly. Once again, I'm unsure of their policy, but she seemed disgusted at the thought of touching the box as well as the contents within. She watched me awkwardly pull meager handfuls out while holding my sleeping toddler. She immediately started stacking the movies with her fingertips in an unknown pattern, without any conversation whatsoever, scanning some and making different piles with others. Partway through, she held up one volume of an anime series and announced she couldn't take any of series since they weren't a complete set. At that point I assumed she meant the one particular series. Several minutes passed, and when I thought she was about halfway done, she had a total for me. She curtly stated she couldn't take any of the discs still on the counter, with no further explanation. I asked about one particular anime series within the rejects, since I knew it was a complete set. She replied that she couldn't tell whether or not it was complete as the individual pieces of the set had no numbers on the spines. Um ... ok? Many DVDs of children's shows were also curiously rejected; I must add that the ones I'm referring to were *not* bargain-bin releases. I'm sure some of what they can buy is dictated by current stock/supply-and-demand/etc., but an explanation of some kind would have been nice.\n\nAnyway, it's apparent that they don't offer any type of receipt for buying, and she couldn't be bothered with helping me get the rejected movies back into my box (maybe they can't help because of insurance or something ...?). Now look, I know they're in the business to make money. I anticipated some of the discs to be deemed worthless in their eyes (I did have a handful of bargain-bin titles, after all). But I couldn't believe how it was handled. I hobbled off a couple of twenties richer with my sleeping toddler and the half-empty box in tow, vaguely hoping that maybe another customer might have the courtesy to open the door for me; it was pretty obvious that the staff couldn't be bothered.\n\nI'm not sure if the experience was worth the forty bucks. Next time I'll try Zia.\n\n*** Edited to add... ***\n\nOk, I did try Zia a few days later with a comparable box (we're cleaning out for a move). The staff was extremely friendly and gave off no weird vibes over touching the box of DVDs.

I am very easy to please when dining, but I do notice my surroundings. It's hard not to... myself, husband and 2 young kids wanted to grab something quick and run. Bad idea on this particular night. It took us just under 2 hours to receive our food and leave. We got there around 10:10 and were in our car at 11:57pm. It  was not extremely busy when we originally arrived. All tables were full except one, no one at the bar top and the couches were empty. Someone walked up and dropped water on our table with no conversation. Finally after another 5 minutes someone else came up and said \"ready to order\". I said \"I would actually like a drink\". She took my drink order and returned with the drink fairly quick, but walked away so I couldn't order with her. Another  7 minutes go by and I get up and flag someone else down to order.  At this point it's been over 15 minutes to even put in our food. We ordered a small bowl of Tom Kha soup, whole fried fish and grilled squid. After about 30 minutes with no one coming to our table for us to reorder a cocktail I finally got up & asked a server if I could order a drink and also questioned where our appetizer soup was. She informed me the kitchen had been backed up and she would check on the soup. She ordered us a new drink which came quick. It must have been close to 40 minutes when the food finally arrived. If the soup could have come quicker \"appetizer\"  it could have really filled the long gap of NO service/food. The whole fried fish was extremely over fried. There was hardly any meat on it & likely was like that since it was just way over cooked. We added one more dish since the fish was so small and made sure to ask if the kitchen was caught up. At this point half the tables had left. She said yea it shouldn't be that long... what do ya know. Another 20+ plus minutes for fried shrimp. We actually asked for the check and to cancel the shrimp. It ended up arriving right then. I left a 10% tip...that was VERY hard for me to do. I still manage to always tip the normal 22% even when service is not to well, so this 10% tip means it was pretty bad for me. You guys need to completely reestablish all steps of services. There is no formal greeting when the server came to the table. There was 3 different people to the table before ordering food. I would expect some sort of introduction, drink order and going over the menu or at least checking if I had any questions on the menu. I am not sure if this place is a \"pulled room\", but we had all 5 servers in there at some point for each trip they made to the table. Your biggest down fall is COMMUNICATION. If your kitchen is backed up, just let me know! Do not let a table sit for 40 minutes with never checking for drinks or informing of kitchen times. Every server was busy doing something, but never slowing their pace passing each guest to  \"table touch\" or giving someone the opportunity to even ask for something. That's the reason I had to physically get up to ask for everything I needed. The table next to us got their food and she then said \"I am still waiting for my tea\". If the tea had been forgotten, the problem would have been fixed if a server touched that table from the time the order was taken to the time the food arrived. There is no system with the staff. One lady that ended up taking our food order who I \"thought was our server\" was then busy behind the empty bar the entire time after...Tables were being bussed by the servers  while the present guests were sitting needing service. If you guys had some strict steps of service, great intro when greeting a table and most importantly COMMUNICATION you would receive amazing reviews and happy guests returning. All the staff was nice and spoke good English which stands out with Thai restaurants here in Las Vegas. The decor was up to date/modern and the restaurant was clean.. also another plus compared to most Thai restaurants here in Vegas. It's not like the food was bad.

I had my car towed to their shop Monday morning (I used my insurance company's free towing service) because the next day I was flying to DC for a business trip and I figured it was a blown gasket and would take several days to repair.

I told them to go forward with the repairs.\n\nA few hours later, I get another call and now I have a blown gasket and a rusted radiator and the repairs will take four days and the new cost is $1600. I protested the radiator because I just got a new radiator not even two years ago. I was accused of putting water in the radiator, causing it to rust, but I don't even know how to do that. I can't even refill  my washer fluid because I'm too short to reach that far under the hood. I was told I wasn't being charged anymore for labor, just the extra parts. I needed my car back, and I was in no position to buy a new one, and I know blown gaskets are usually $2500 minimum to repair, so I told them to proceed.\n\nI eventually got my car back after 15 days (eight days after they originally said it'd be ready) and the bill was $1600 like originally promised so I paid. My passenger seat had a plastic bag on it that I guess was supposed to protect from stains from the mechanics, but there was still a palm-sized black grease smudge on the seat and a metal part sitting in my passenger seat.

It's not listed on my bill at all, not even to indicate the discount.\nAlso, I bought a Yelp deal which theoretically should have lowered the cost, but it seems as though they just added an extra charge to balance it out.\n\nThe shop manager offered to give me a free oil change because I had to wait so long for my car. Which annoyed me because according to my bill I was already charged for an oil change.\n\nShortly after getting my car back it was struggling to start, the heater wasn't working, and when I slowed down or hit a bump, you can hear something rattling under my hood.

Had the car towed to their shop and was told the radiator hose was blown. That made me furious because they just replaced my radiator, wouldn't they have seen a faulty hose? I'm out another $100+.\n\nThen I'm told I should just get a new car because the next time I bring it to them they'll probably have to replace the engine. \n\nI wish I had taken their advice when my car first blew its gasket, instead I feel like I threw away $2,000; money I could have invested in a new car, which I did eventually end up buyi", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "First and foremost, I spent many years growing up in \"the hood\" near Chicago.

I guess Josh assumed I didn't because he and Sam were speaking in Korean and Josh REPEATEDLY cursed and called Sam a derogatory name. Oscar of course did not speak Korean and when he said something to Josh (nothing bad, just about the food), Josh called him another derogatory name in Korean. I could tell from their interaction Oscar was used to Josh saying something to him in Korean and not knowing what it was. Josh just kept talking like that to his coworkers, even going into his dislike for the current job. I came to enjoy a nice lunch. Did I have to sit there and listen to this? I don't care if you think I don't speak Korean. The fact that the chef can stand there in front of customers and belittle his coworkers and talk like that is completely disrespectful. Not to mention there was another couple at the sushi bar and he talked about them as well. \n\nAn employee was refilling my drink and he was not dressed like the wait staff so I asked if he was the manager and he said he was. I told him I didn't appreciate having to eat my lunch in an environment where the chef is cursing throughout my lunch and he said he will talk to them. He didn't even ask me which chef it was and instead, right in front of me, asked to see Sam. Sam went behind the curtain with the manager and within seconds, Josh followed Sam. They all came back less than a minute later and that was it. Sam and Josh was smiling and laughing when they came back to behind the bar.\n\nThis was truly an absurd lunch.

The hotel is about a quarter mile from the strip, so if you have the itch to be in the middle of the Vegas action then it's a short walk away. The other benefit of staying at this location is that you do not have to walk the gauntlet of poker machines, table games and old ladies puffing on their cigarettes to make it to the check in desk. Both of those are great, but what you are paying for is the room. \n\nThe casino is owned by a separate company rather than Westin. Most of the games are slots and electronic poker. There are a handful of table games.  It's a non smoking hotel, but a smoking casino...which makes for a smoking hotel. \n\nCheck in was easy and friendly. The front desk agent was very helpful and informative. A nice start to our stay. Rooms are lacking quite a bit compared to their competition, and our room just smelled like Chinese take out. The double rooms are fairly tight and do not offer much room to move around. The tube TV is out dated, the furniture is stained along with the carpet and wallpaper is peeling.  The bathrooms are average sized and offer all the amenities you would expect from a Westin. However, the water pressure for the shower is miserable, and their Heavenly Shower with a double head on it is pointless. I prefer a shower that works properly before they start attaching the bells and whistles on it. The Heavenly Beds are comfortable and the AC works great. Finally, the housekeeping is a joke. The only service they provide is making the bed. Forget about organizing the room or the bathroom. \n\nThe non resort Westin charges a resort fee for things you never or rarely use...like incoming faxes.  It's like an apartment charging you pet rent.  It makes no sense.  They also state that your $11 daily fee gets you \"free\" water.  I can't quite figure that one out.  \n\nA 24 hour Starbucks is in the lobby, so if you're hitting the slots and on a roll at 4am and need to keep going, you can grab your coffee.

The skate was interesting, but the potatoes were completely burnt on one side (they were served good side up) and the charred taste was overpowering so I was unable to enjoy them. The greens were so bitter that they weren't edible either. My husband got the halibut, which was cooked well, but the sauce it was in had no flavor and did not complement the fish well at all.

Salad King used to be one of the best Thai restaurants downtown Toronto, no contest.

No sweet and savoury combination of flavour, very few bits of mushroom and a few bits of chicken with lots of tendons still attached, topped with a giant piece of wilted lettuce. I've had better at Thai food chain restaurants! Spring rolls were average, the vegetables inside were cut too large and not the usual meticulously chopped veggies of Spring Rolls of the past. Panang Curry: the sauce was still good but again, low quality chicken and a few very thin shreds of green and red peppers and that's it. We got take out and it was hard to tell which was the curry main dish and which was the soup! Steamed rice was fine, but you have to work hard to screw that up. Golden Curry...wow, what a huge disappointment. Barely any chicken or vegetables. The prices are average, not exceptionally cheap but the food is cheap in quality and amount. I certainly won't waste my time making the drive down for what once was excellent quality Thai food. There are much better places in Scarborough who provide delicious food with quality ingredients in generous amounts for reasonable prices  AND they include free spring rolls or an additional entree when you spent more than $40 or $50.

I called Sonata's and was told that they have changed their menu and don't carry the same items that Door Dash lists. So, they just cancel orders.

We were seated promptly at our reserved time.\n\nThe service was immediately kind of odd. Our waiter did not give us menus (other than for drinks), but instead started talking about how if we had a particular budget in mind, they could send us enough food to fill that budget. Butbutbut...I saw the menu online! I knew there was a menu. I wanted to be in CONTROL! Would the waiter let us be in control?\n\nAfter awhile yes, yes he did. We were able to secure some menus, and he then proceeded to go through the different sections of the menu with us as if we were eight years old and/or eating dinner by ourselves at a restaurant for the first time. Is fusion really that scary for people?\n\nSo we ordered a couple of rounds, tapas style, like we do. There were hits and misses along the way. The best stuff was in the robata area of the menu. The pork belly with the butterscotch miso about slayed me with its awesomeness. The duck breast dish we got was also killer, with a fantastic sauce and lots of meaty, meaty mushrooms. The Shishito peppers were solid, as was the sea eel we got nigiri style. It's hard to mess those two up. The yamato rolls, in all their decadence, were worth every penny.\n\nThe seared wagyu beef was probably the biggest miss of the evening. The menu does not list truffle oil in the dish's ingredients, but that's about all I could taste. And for me, truffle oil makes everything taste and smell rancid. Not appealing. The El Topo, while quite good, was also a bit of a disappointment. I love fried onions, but they seemed to overpower here. The yellowtail sashimi also seemed a bit off, as the lemongrass sauce wasn't particularly complimentary. \n\nThe service was alright but stayed a little odd during our visit. Sometimes our waiter would be absent for long periods of time, and then suddenly would be around almost too often. The place was loud, almost too loud.

What I can speak about is that there are quite a few selections for the vegetarian, including lots of appetizers and a great bento set.

The restaurant is quite small, clean, and seats up to 18 people in the whole place. \n\nWuhan specializes in hot dry egg noodles, some exotic sounding meats (like chicken gristle, duck feet, duck heart, duck head), and as well as some other noodle soups. Rice noodles are also available. The sizeable portion of noodles is served with a small amount of sauce at the bottom of the bowl. The sauce is a blend of sesame paste, hot chili oil, green onions, cilantro and small amounts of vegetables that you mix your dry noodles into to coat them. \n\nI ordered the beef dry noodles and hubby ordered the chicken dry noodles. I found my beef slices to be somewhat dry in consistency. The chicken looked less dry as it consisted of pieces of dark meat. The noodles were flavourful but the sesame paste was a bit thick and it helped to have hot water to wash the noodles down. I would have appreciated something like pickled vegetables to have on the side, but perhaps that is not in keeping with the regional cuisine.\n\nThe level of spice can be customized. Be warned that if you have a low tolerance to spice like me, you may be best to go with no spice! My mouth was burning as I ate most of my bowl of \"mild\" dry noodles! One of the staff told me that these types of dry hot noodles are traditionally served with vinegar as a condiment, which actually helped to balance out the heat in the dish. Service staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nAll in all, for the two noodle dishes, our bill came out to about $23. A little pricey for noodles in my opinion. They have even more expensive dishes, such as noodles with crab ($15), which might be interesting to try.

It's not the rich old people of South Park.  Restaurants like Table and Solara have closed while Moe's is always busy.  Ballantyne is a suburb within the city, complete with soccer moms and kids.  They want a place to take their kids, and MM fits the bill, as shown by most of its clientele.  Like a recent article I read about them said \"Feed the kings and live like the masses.  Feed the masses and live like the kings.\"\n\nAnyway, onto the food and experience.  I knew they would be super busy on a Saturday night, so I called in a to go order.

I got to the restaurant, found a parking space (few people realize there's tons of parking behind it), and walked into the crowd.  The set up is far from efficient with to go orders as well as people waiting to be seated all crowded into the same tiny area at the front.  Also, this is a good haul from the kitchen so there is a lot of disconnect about whose order is ready.

Second, i got half beef and half black olives on it, but beef ended up on all but 2 of the 8 slices.  The dough was nice and thick, which is what I have always loved about MM pizza.  There was a little too much sauce on the pizza but it was okay (we almost always ordered their white pizzas before but I wanted a regular pizza this time).  The wings.  Oh the wings.  Probably the worst I have had.  Ever.  Anywhere.  Tiny, baked, pres-sauced, and possibly even parbaked?  I hope not.  The blue cheese was runny after sitting in the container for who knows how long.  I realize this place is new and slam packed, but please don't short cuts.  \n\nThe 3 stars is because the pizza was actually good despite the issues with it.

Just as I made my way past the bar I saw the only thing I was not expecting - an empty craps table. No players fine, but no Dealers?!  What happened?!?  I asked one of the suits and was told that they closed at 3am.  I could have easily been there had I not been provided bad info twice.  I'm bummed, sad, mad...\n\nWell, I'm here so I might as well stay around til 10am and see if anything special happens when the table games close.  I jump on the roulette table and play for the final 40 minutes.  About half of that time is spent listening to passer-bys ask if they can buy chips while the dealer explains that they can't.  The cashier wasn't selling chips and the only other tables (BJ) were usually full.\n\nI do appreciate that the pit supervisor let us know when there were 3 spins left so that we wouldn't be blindsided that the game was over.  On the final spin I go all in (you have to right? I was the only one who did though).  The prior spin winning # was 19 so I'm on red, odd and 5 individual #s including the last winning #.  Sure enough 19 hits again and I cash about a $150 profit. That helps ease a bit of the pain of missing the final craps session which was what I had been looking forward to for weeks.\n\nDoors were closing at 2pm but I'm not a slot player and it sure didn't look or feel like anything ceremonial was going to happen so I take a few pics and head back to the Encore to check out.\n\nFarewell Sahara", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Ann is the BEST!

Also, I didn't taste much tomato flavor in the hollandaise sauce. Sorry! I know a lot of people on here raved about it but I guess it just didn't cater to my taste buds.

While it is a re-brand of the Monte Carlo, they did (or rather are in the process of doing) an extensive renovation that makes it pretty much has touched every inch of the property. During our recent stay, it looks like they still have a bit of work to do along the strip frontage of the hotel. Also, a lot of the new food and beverage options are still under construction (ie. Eataly and the new Roy Choi venture). \n\nWhile the upgrades to the property are nice (it feels a bit more refined than back when it was the Monte Carlo), I still think of Park MGM as a solid mid-tier resort and not a luxury resort like Aria or Bellagio next-door. Check in at the lobby was very impersonal - they have a bank of check in machines (similar to ATMs) that have replaced a standard lobby area. While staff is on hand to help if you get confused, I can see this area being very hectic as there is just a central area with no clear lines. *TIP* there are machines over by the elevator as well that you can use to check in if the main check in area is too chaotic. \n\nThe room was decent - a bit eccentric with random wall art and a large couch. To be honest, it felt rather plain. The bathroom was nice with a large standing shower, but again, not very luxurious. While this is fine if your room rate is sub $100 a night or something, I wouldn't want to pay much more then that to stay here. Also note that parking is an additional $15 a night. The hotel still doesn't really feel like a destination (maybe things will improve once Eataly opens). It has a great location, being connected to Aria and easily accessible to the City Center tram with access to Crystals and Bellagio. However, there's nothing at the hotel that really gives you a reason to stay.  \n\nIt'll be interesting to see where MGM positions Park MGM in their hotel portfolio... if it stays reasonable priced in the mid-tier, I'm a fan, but if they try to charge Aria prices for a gussied up Monte Carlo, I would have a much different opinion.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Robyn did a great job on my color and hair cut.

The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.

Add to this the fact that the \"hallways\" are all outdoors, and in some cases just feet away from the pool and/or parking lot, and it can result in you being awoken late at night by an inconsiderate guest.\n\nThere's almost no closet space in the rooms; there's just a tiny wardrobe with enough space to hang about 6 garments and 2 tiny drawers.  It's a good thing my girlfriend doesn't mind living out of her suitcase while on vacation, since there's no way both of us could have fit our clothes in there.\n\nDuring our 4 night stay, despite the fact that we got maid service every day, we ran out of both toilet paper and kleenex.  The kleenex was both understandable and forgivable, since it's hard to tell when the box is going to run out ahead of time, but there's really no excuse for not leaving a spare roll of TP when you see the current roll is getting low.\n\nThe pool towels were low quality, and left orange fuzz all over my swimsuit.  Not a huge deal, but annoying nonetheless.]\n\nThe free coffee in the guest lounge was never ready and available; the guests were left to brew their own.  Another small thing, but it added 10 minutes to the time it took us to get ready each morning.\n\n\nNow that that's out of the way, the positives:\n\nThe whole hotel is decorated in a really funky orange, brown, and gray theme, which may sound horrible on paper but looks great in real life.  Both my girlfriend and I really liked it.\n\nHaving a hot tub in the room was a blast (Sip wine and watch TV while I soak?  Don't mind if I do!), and the rooms with the tub were only $10 more per night.  I would have expected a much bigger markup.\n\nThe entire property, including the rooms, was very clean and well-maintained.\n\nThe room had a HUGE flat screen HDTV and a DVD player.  Having the option to stay in and pick up a redbox movie one night of our trip was unexpected and awesome.\n\nThe front desk staff were all very friendly.\n\nThe pool and hot tub were great, and there were plenty of lounge chairs for sitting and reading or just soaking up some sun.\n\nThe fitness center was small, but well equipped and very clean.\n\nFree parking!\n\n\nAs you can see, there are more positives than negatives, but overall, despite the 4 star rating, I probably wouldn't stay here again.

I'm closer to 40 than 30, so we were looking to have \"grown-up fun,\" as opposed to the usual Vegas shenanigans. (though it looks like those can be found EVERYWHERE). We've also stayed all over the Strip- from the Four Seasons  and Wynn to the Luxor and MGM Grand, so were excited to try something new and upscale.\n\nWe had a Studio room with a fountain view that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the Strip and it was amazing. The room was great-- the perfect size- and we liked the open floorplan. The decor is lovely and we felt very at home and comfortable for the three days we spent there. Definitely book a room on a higher floor-- we were on 33 and I think I wouldn't want to be lower than 27ish for the view we had.\n\nThe check-in/out/front desk/concierge staff were all great-- as were our waiters in all of the restos where we dined. Everyone was VERY attentive and it seemed like that was a priority throughout the resort, sans the doormen- of which I actually never saw one (maybe they dont have??)\n\nWe got drinks at the Chandelier bar, which is fun and a very cool, unique idea. The casino is actually pretty small, but it was fun and much nicer than the places that seem to go on forever. They have interesting art to look at and the LED screen pillars in the lobby are a very cool touch.\n\nWe had an AMAZING dinner at Scarpetta. The food and wine were delicious and the service was impeccable. I LOVED our waiter!! We had a table for two right in the window facing the same Bellagio fountain-- I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner. I will definitely go back the next time we visit LV.\n\nWe grabbed a quick lunch at the hidden pizza place one day-- and it was DELISH. there was a long line out the door and no sign marking the place-- and you could see why. it's a definite must for anyone staying at the hotel... We had lunch at Holstein's the following day- which was a good place to go if you want upscale diner food. I'm a Veggie, so the burgers (which are apparently pretty good)- were wasted on me- but my onion rings and milkshake were quite tasty. :)\n\nWe spent one afternoon at the Spa and Hammam. I visit spas around the world and consider myself an aficionado of sorts, so was a bit surprised that I was disappointed with this one in the end. The decor is ok and the staff mixed-- the girls in the locker room couldn't have cared less as it related to \"service\" and jammed everyone visiting the spa into one area of the locker room so we were all on top of one another. My husband and I BOTH noted that they also should have a clock or two in the spa, so you know how much time you have before your treatment appointment. I was also given the wrong size shoes and robe and it was also VERY messy-- there were open/used lockers and towels dropped on the floor or draped on doors in every corner, as well as an overflowing wastebasket of water bottles in the jacuzzi area. kind of gross...  we got a couples treatment in the Hammam, which was actually beautiful inside. the room itself felt very natural and modern at the same time and the heated stone is VERY cool. Our treatment (Red Flower Hammam Experience or something like that) wasn't at all what I expected from the written or verbal description I received (a bit lack-lustre) and IF we were to go back (which I probably wouldn't)- I'd opt for a massage with an add on scrub instead. I hate leaving disappointed and not relaxed-- especially after dropping $700 in about 2 hours- but hey, it was an experience and you have to try to know.\n\nthe only other fault we found with our otherwise delightful Cosmo experience is the \"dog-friendliness\" of the hotel. As all of their commercials feature Great Danes (and other animals), we assumed it was a dog friendly hotel. It turns out it is- if your dog weighs less than 20lbs. Ours is about 10lbs, so it was fine (though I still think it's weird they show giant dogs in the elevator in those spots!)-- but the hotel ISN'T really dog-FRIENDLY. The Four Seasons and W chains offer in-room services and even menus for dogs-- they have dog beds, bowls, toys and leashes waiting in your room when you arrive or send them up- and offer pet-sitting and special treats, etc.-- but there was NOTHING at the Cosmo. As its Vegas, and there's nowhere to really TAKE your dog \"outside\"- they do have a dog run-- it's about 3ft wide and 10ft long. With as much real-estate that this place has dedicated to everything, we were REALLY surprised that they didn't have a grassy area where guests could sit and play with their dogs-- even a 12x12ft space would do, considering the dog size restrictions. Actually-- it would be GENIUS if they had a place that was a dog store, daycare, grooming and \"park\" area, as people pay big bucks for these services and I'm sure clients and locals alike would LOVE it.\n\nAnyway-- that's my novel of a review on our stay at the Cosmopolitan... all in all, I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Great wings, great chicken, great quesadillas.

You're also entitled to check in at the VIP autograph lounge where there's coffee, water, paper, and shorter lines.\n\nDespite being not so new anymore the hotel is still \"hot\". It's trendy, a lot of people my age and slightly older stay here. Though I hate Marquee (their club) with a passion, it still seems really popular. They've got a few bars, like the chandelier and Vesper which are cool hang out spots and have great, albeit expensive drinks. It's just a \"happening\" hotel still so staying here is really convenient, you're part of the action automatically by virtue of being present. It's great for people like me who enjoy shitshows but don't want to partake. Their location is also excellent, we never had to drive once. It's across the bridge from miracle mile shops, walking distance for walgreens and earl of sandwich. We also somehow walked all the way to NYNY too for shake shack. Either way, thumbs way way up for not having to grab cabs or ubers the entire weekend. \n\nI've stayed in the Terrace One Bedroom and also the Terrace Studio. Obviously the bedroom is more expensive because of the Japanese soaking tub but the studio has the jet tub. Either way I find both comfortable, there's a large living area, a kitchenette, super soft king sized bed, big closets and a terrace. Their suites are pretty massive anyway so it's great to have your friends over and hang out. The mini fridge is slightly annoying because it's all rigged with temptations, like a can of coke for $6 and you can't use it to chill your own drinks unless you put it in the freezer section. There's rigged snacks and shaving kits, etc on the counter but there's also a mini bottle opener for free you can use which is thoughtful! I panicked for a moment when I tried to open my wine and had realized I didn't bring a bottle opener. Appreciate the touch! \n\nThey've also got very nice quality robes and slippers and C.O. Bigelow toiletries! Usually shampoo/conditioner from a hotel is total crap but theirs is actually decent. The rooms and hallways show wear and tear but they've done a decent job of covering it up. I imagine in a few years they'll need to redo carpeting and give the place a fresh coat of paint. Also, Cosmo is super clean and reminded me a little of my private undergraduate university, people are cleaning ALL THE TIME. It's ridiculous, you can see people cleaning 24/7, everywhere. There are many people who work very hard to maintain the hotel so be nice to them!!! Tip generously. Aside from this the casinos are also one of the cleanest ever, somehow the cigarette smoke is absorbed and dispelled elsewhere so you don't stink of cigarettes while you walk around. \n\nParking is free which is great and may no longer be a perk we can enjoy in vegas much more, staff are courteous and nice. I wish they were a bit more clear on the perks for booking through visa signature. I've done this twice and each time they forget to tack on the $25 food/bev credit so I always have to go down to the check out desk. Either way, I always have a good time here and it's really appropriate for where I am in my life now that I don't want to get dressed up, wait 20 minutes in cold for cab, get ripped off, get in line for 40 minutes to get into some dumb club. I'd rather have one nice $16 drink than a bunch of Fat Tuesdays, this is the hot yuppie hotel for me! \n\nAlso Yelp just reminded me by asking \"good for kids\" the answer is NO. Vegas as a city unless you're doing something wholesome like seeing the hoover dam or grand canyon is NOT good for children. My friends saw a couple with a damn STROLLER at 11PM at night in the elevators here. A drunken person almost ran into their stroller/baby and it's vegas, can you REALLY blame the person for being drunk in sin city or the irresponsible parents who are keeping their infant out past 11pm? Ugh, just think through what you're doing parents.\n\nOne FINAL thought, I HATE the bathroom walls. I've posted a picture and you can see it's black wallpaper with a repeating silhouette of conjoined girls dancing or something and when you're hungover or puking it's THE WORST. It makes me dizzy when I'm sober so when you're drunk? *shudders* Just No.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Airy space, fresh beer on tap and tasty delicious food...I am definitely coming back this summer so I can enjoy a beer in the patio!", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "This restaurant is easily 4 stars in my book.

We also had the chicken wings, fried calamari, and jalape\u00f1o poppers for apps. Each dish was $4 with the exception of the mushrooms ($2). The meats were really good quality, and my favorite was the bulgogi which was really tender and had a great marinade. The chicken wings were average, crispy but pretty bland. The poppers were filled with cream cheese and salmon with a tempura batter. The calamari were okay as well, but the breading was disappointingly flavorless, much like the chicken wings. The dipping sauce that came with it added some much needed flavor to the dish.\n\nThe service was relatively spotty. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our order quickly. Afterwards however it was kind of difficult to get anyone's attention as the restaurant became more busy, so we had to flag down someone each time we needed something. Our appetizers also came out way after the meats, so we were pretty much done with our food by the time our last appetizer came out.\n\nAlso keep in mind rice is not included when you order dishes a la cartel for happy hour. It's $2 for a bowl and 1 bowl is enough for 2 to share.\n\nI must admit though that I think the reviews for this place are somewhat inflated because they give you a free desert if you write and show them a posted Yelp review.

The pico de gallo is super fresh and tasty. Top it off with a squeeze of fresh lime and their amaaaazing green sauce and you have a feast!

From my people watching skills, honed over the years of odd stares and quick glances from the corner of my eyes, it seemed the adults enjoy pouring out the soft yoghurt more than the kiddies. Personal confession - even though my 2 year old poured out 5 different flavors of yoghurt in one cup, I found it secretly very satisfying to make neat compartmental swirls as the yoghurt poured out.  Yes as you raise your eye-brows right about now - you are not limited in the number of flavors you pour in your medium sized cup. Chocolate next to Key Lime Sorbet & Island Banana atop Strawberry Cream with Snickers & mini marshmallow topping - turned out to be a very tasteful explosion of sweet and at time tart fireworks in my mouth. Of course it was a matter of spooning around, sometimes spooning through, and at times spooning about the flavors to enjoy this custom concotion.\n\nIf by now all the talk about spooning has gotten your mind swirling then my friend you are thinking of the yoghurt swirls of Menchies.  First take your sweetie to Menchies, over-indulge on the sweet swirls of your personal creations, share spoonfuls and be sure to extend the spooning theme in intimate privacy of your cozy space.\n\nBe aware the inside space if very small, despite the 4 small parlor tables inside and 2 more such tables by the doorstep outside, seating is extremely limited. I hope they can relocate to a larger indoor space - otherwise winter time visits to Menchies would lend itself to be very difficult.

The hype is real, y'all. \n\nI have been so excited for Haberdish to join the Charlotte culinary scene and it was worth the wait. Real talk: this is the only restaurant where I will ever order chicken tenders. You win #alltheawards for chicken tenders. \n\nBefore I talk about the rest of the food, here's an important life hack for this place: get on your Yelp app and use the wait list option. Yes, you can literally put yourself on the waitlist. It's always going to be busy. Don't act surprised, don't bitch about it, just deal with it. And if you don't feel like waiting (or talking to human beings), you can get on the Haberdish website and place to go orders. \n\nOur visit here we got: cheese straws (the only thing we didn't love), dill house pickles (bread & butter and a daily option as available), biscuits & bacon jam (the winner of the apps), deviled eggs (a very close runner up), chicken tenders, smoked chicken (Alabama White Sauce is what made this dish), sweet potato dumplings, mac n cheese with crispy chicken skins, broccolini, charred okra, tots, and the waffle for dessert. Before you plan an eating intervention for me, please note that this was all split among four people. I thought everything was delicious. I love their homemade hot sauce. The table as a whole did not love the sweet potato dumplings. They are different. I liked them, though I may not order them every time because there are so many delicious side options. On Sundays, they do chicken and waffles. Tuesdays, chicken and biscuits. \n\nI didn't do a cocktail this visit, just a glass of ros\u00e8. Colleen was just named Charlotte's best bartender by Thrillist. I have no doubt you can't go wrong with a drink here. \n\nThe most surprising thing for me was how affordable a meal can be. I paid for my ros\u00e8, an app, couple chicken tenders, couple sides, part of the dessert and spent less than $30 (before tip). \n\nIf you're not familiar with NoDa, a warning that parking completely blows in this neighborhood.

The friendly, calm-yet-quick, service, and a place where people will recognize you as a person not just a dollar sign (our server Sonia was so great...especially considering they were trying to clean up/close up but never kicked us out or gave us dirty looks or anything).\n\nOh and I also love that they still have their original menu from like, 1957 up on the wall so people can jokingly ask for a small fries for 15 cents.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "I love this place.

Most of the negative reviews comment on the service, but I had no issue with it. Our server was nice, and pretty funny. Our food came out at different times, which was a little awkward, but it was so delicious that I honestly have no complaints. Food is good, service is good, price was okay.

No matter where I travel, I always end up comparing a burger I try elsewhere to a Golden Star burger.

Decor hasn't changed in years, and likely isn't going to change. Fine by me, but it would be nice if one day they started taking credit cards. For now, as it has always been, cash only. \n\nI usually ask for my fries well-done. As the fries are thicker cut fries, I find that sometimes when Golden Star is busy, the fries tend to get undercooked.

They say to never let anyone touch your hair unless you absolutely, positively trust them. Moments Salon was a referral. Hesitant but new to Phoenix I booked an appointment. \n\nI've written a glowing review previously. Please read that if you have moment.\n\nRecently I returned in despair. If you've experienced hair trauma you understand.  I had strayed from Moments Salon. No bueno. (It just happened.)\n\nSusan, my super awesome favorite stylist, was able to magically squeeze me in. Another client had an emergency and an appointment was available. \n\nIn what can only be described as a miracle, my chemically fried (and questionably cut) hair was fixed. I had resorted to hiding until a solution could be found. When I peeked into the mirror I sighed in relief. While Susan and I had thumbed thru Pinterest I implicitly trusted her scissors (and color). \"Cut it Susan! Fix it please. ..just do something.\"\n\nI love my hair. That may sound so incredibly vain. But I do! Thank you Susan for sprinkling your fairy-rainbow-leprechaun dust everywhere.  My hair is super easy to style. Variable options. Professional when needed. Cute if I want it to be. The fella really likes it too \n\nStaff Shout Outs\nSitting in Susan's chair is always a treat. Her timing is over the top with John's station. He is quite possibly the funniest human on earth. (S-e-r-i-o-u-s-l-y) The front desk is the bomb. Virginia warmly greets guests as though Moments Salon is her home. Kathleen is my 2nd favorite person at Moments. That woman can do anything with hair. \n\nHere's the thing tho. I've met tons of people here.\nOne day I was bored and decided my fringe bangs could go up. Monica made short order of them (ha!) and colored my hair. Luuurv her! In another fit of panic I learned an evening event was formal. Not quite dressed for it Moments squeezed me in for a quick blowout. Alicia has mad skills.\n \nMoments Salon is filled with wonderful people. They offer a range of beauty services.

They paid more, so to repeat the advice I got from others: don't go to a bank no matter how preferred you think your rate is and how much money you have at the bank.
